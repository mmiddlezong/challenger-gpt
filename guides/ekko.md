# Naafiri Mid Matchup Guide: **Ekko**

> **Matchup summary:** Ekko is a mobile AP assassin who can *deny your solo-kill reliability* with **R** and *hard punish bad commits* with **W stun + shield**. Your consistent win comes from **wave/tempo control, clean trades that deny his passive, and converting forced recalls into plates/roams**—not from repeatedly trying to 100–0 him while his ultimate is up.

## Ekko spell cheat sheet (read this first)

**Passive – Z-Drive Resonance (3-hit proc)**
- After **3 hits** on you, Ekko procs bonus damage and gets a big movespeed burst.
- **What to avoid:** letting him get the **3rd stack** for free (it’s what makes his trades “unfair”).

**Q – Timewinder (boomerang)**
- Projectile out + return. If you get hit twice, you eat a lot of damage and it helps him proc passive.
- **What to avoid:** getting hit by **both** passes, especially while he’s walking up to complete the passive.

**W – Parallel Convergence**
- Big zone that “arms” after a delay. If you’re inside when it completes: **STUN** (hard CC).
- If Ekko enters the zone when it completes: he gets a **shield**.
- **What to avoid (critical):**
  - **Do not be inside when it pops** → avoid the **stun**
  - **Do not fight him when he procs the shield** unless you’re disengaging or you have a huge advantage

**E – Phase Dive**
- Short dash, then a targeted blink/empowered auto. This is his main way to force passive procs.
- **What to avoid:** standing in range after he’s dashed once; he’s looking to blink-auto you and complete passive.

**R – Chronobreak**
- Rewinds Ekko to his “afterimage” from a few seconds ago, **heals** him, and does **AoE burst** where he appears.
- **What to avoid (critical):**
  - Trying to “solo all-in” as if he doesn’t have R (you usually can’t stop him pressing it)
  - Standing on/near his **afterimage** during a fight (you’ll eat the R burst if he presses it)

## How this matchup is actually won (Naafiri perspective)

### Your reliable win conditions
1) **Wave/tempo advantage → plates/roams**
   - Crash waves, disappear, pressure sides. Ekko is strong at roams too, so your goal is to **move first** or **punish his roam** with plates and vision control.

2) **Deny his passive trades**
   - If Ekko can’t consistently proc passive on you, his laning becomes much less threatening.

3) **Force his R defensively, then convert**
   - If you can force Ekko to press R to survive, you don’t always need to chase. Take the **wave + plate + reset** and play aggressively while his R is down.

4) **Kill windows are mostly “with CC”**
   - Solo-killing Ekko through R is unreliable because Naafiri has no hard CC.
   - Your best kills are with **jungler/teammate CC**, or when Ekko misuses R.

---

## Lane plan (by phases)

### Levels 1–2: keep HP high, don’t donate passive procs
- Your goal is **stable CS + health**.
- Trade only if it’s **free** (e.g., he used Q on the wave and can’t hit you with both passes).
- If Ekko gets **2 passive stacks**, immediately **kite back** and break the trade.

**Key rule:** You can lose tiny bits of CS early. You can’t lose half your HP bar to “prove a point.”

---

### Levels 3–5: respect W setups, punish wasted cooldowns
This is where Ekko’s patterns start to matter.

**What Ekko wants:**
- Short trade: Q tags → E blink-auto → passive proc → he runs away fast.
- Or: threaten W so you can’t stand on the wave, then trade with E while you’re zoned.

**What you want:**
- Short trades that do **not** allow his passive:
  - Q poke/sustain, then back off.
  - If he E’s in, respond with **your W/E** to deny the blink-auto or to disengage.

**Punish windows:**
- If Ekko uses **W** to zone/farm and doesn’t stun you:
  - You have a window to play up, take wave control, and look for a crash/roam.
- If Ekko uses **E** aggressively and doesn’t get value:
  - He’s vulnerable for the next few seconds. This is a good time to trade harder or call for a gank.

---

### Level 6+: treat his R as a second health bar + escape
**Default mindset:** if Ekko’s R is up, assume you **cannot** reliably kill him solo.

**Good ways to use your pressure post-6:**
- **Force R → take plate/wave/tempo**
  - If you commit and he R’s out, don’t autopilot chase into fog. Crash, plate, reset.
- **Set up ganks**
  - Communicate: “Ekko no E / Ekko used W” = gank window.
  - Your damage is great; you just need someone to hold him in place.

**Bad ways to play post-6:**
- R-in for a “hope kill,” he presses R, you’re now deep with cooldowns down, and you die to his re-entry or enemy jungler.

---

## Trading rules (the “always” rules)

### Rule 1: Don’t let him proc passive on you
- When you have **2 passive stacks**, back up immediately.
- Your goal is to make his trades look like:
  - “Ekko hits 1–2 times, Naafiri backs off, Ekko can’t complete 3.”

### Rule 2: Never eat Q twice if you can help it
- If Q hits you on the way out, **sidestep the return path**.
- If you can’t dodge both, prioritize dodging the **return** if it would give him the passive proc.

### Rule 3: Treat W as a “no-go zone”
- When you see the W zone: **leave it**. Don’t “finish the trade.”
- If Ekko is trying to E into the zone as it pops:
  - Hold your **E** to exit the zone, or
  - Use your **W** timing if you absolutely can’t exit in time (last-resort outplay).

### Rule 4: Your W is a RESPONSE tool in this matchup
- If you W too early (just for speed), Ekko can wait it out and then E → passive you.
- Prefer to W when:
  - he commits E blink-auto timing,
  - you need to dodge a critical damage moment,
  - or you’re fully committing to a kill/force-R play with a clear plan.

### Rule 5: Don’t chase into fog after he Rs
- If Ekko uses R to escape, your conversion is usually:
  - **shove → plate → ward → reset**
- Chasing blind is how you get turned on by W or collapsed on by jungle/support.

## Wave management (how to stop Ekko from “owning the map”)

### Your best wave states
- **Slightly toward your side** (mini-freeze / slow hold):
  - Forces Ekko to walk up for CS → gives you trading windows and makes ganks easier.
- **Slow push → crash** when you want to roam/reset:
  - Build 2 waves, crash under tower, then move.

### What not to do
- **Perma-shove without vision**
  - Ekko + jungler with W is lethal. If you shove, you must have a plan (warded sides + jungler info).

### When Ekko roams
You must decide quickly:
- **If you can match in time** (and it’s not a guaranteed W trap), match immediately.
- Otherwise:
  - **Hard shove and take plates**, ping spam, and drop vision on his return path.

**Consistency tip:** Matching late is usually the worst option (you lose wave AND arrive after the play).

## Jungle interaction (how you actually get kills on Ekko)

### Best gank windows
- Ekko used **E** (can’t dash away as easily)
- Ekko used **W** and missed / used it on wave
- Wave is held on your side and he must step up

### How to play the gank
- You don’t need to start with your hardest commit.
- Let Ekko spend a defensive tool first (E or R), then commit.
- If your jungler has CC, your job is to **stay in range** and keep damage on him.

### Avoiding ganks yourself
- If Ekko disappears off-wave and you don’t have vision: assume **W from fog** into a gank.
- Back up until you see jungle info.

## Post-6 “all-in” decision guide (quick)

Only commit a full R-in if at least ONE is true:
- Ekko’s **R is down**
- You have nearby **CC** (jungler/support/top TP angle)
- Ekko is extremely low and you’re confident you can kill before he can safely R (rare, and still risky)

Otherwise, prefer:
- trade → force R → convert plates/tempo
- or crash → roam

---

## Mid/Late game plan vs Ekko

### Your positioning and vision rules
- Don’t clump in choke points when you don’t see Ekko.
- Place control wards to deny his flank angles.
- If he can W a choke and walk in for shield, your teamfight becomes messy fast.

### How fights usually play out
- Ekko wants to flank and assassinate, then R out.
- You want to flank and assassinate, but you also need to respect the “Ekko re-entry” after R.

### Practical fight advice
- If Ekko dives your backline:
  - If you can kill him quickly with teammates, do it.
  - Otherwise, trade backline-for-backline (delete their carry faster than he deletes yours).
- Don’t stand on his afterimage. Ever. (If he can R on top of you, he will.)

## Common mistakes (that lose this matchup)

- **Trying to solo kill through Ekko R** repeatedly
- **Getting stunned by W** because you “wanted one more hit”
- **Using your W offensively too early**, then eating E + passive with no answer
- **Following roams late** into fog and W traps
- **Chasing after he Rs** instead of taking guaranteed plates/tempo

---

## Learning objectives (focus 5 games)

### Objective 1 — Passive denial
- Track: “How many times did Ekko proc passive on me before 10 minutes?”
- Target: **0–2** procs (you’ll feel the lane become way easier).

### Objective 2 — W discipline
- Track: “How many W stuns did I take?”
- Target: **0**.

### Objective 3 — Q double-hit avoidance
- Track: “How often did I get hit by both Q passes?”
- Target: **≤2** times pre-10.

### Objective 4 — Tempo decisions after crash
- Track: Every crash should become **ward / roam / reset** (no standing mid).
- Target: **80%+** of crashes converted into a purposeful action.

### Objective 5 — R usage quality
After every game, list each time you used R and label it:
- **KILL**
- **FORCED R**
- **OBJECTIVE/PLATE**
- **BAD COMMIT**
Target: **No more than 1 bad commit** per game.

---

## Optional “comfort” adjustments (if you’re struggling)
- Consider a defensive summoner (Barrier/Exhaust) if Ekko is consistently one-shotting you.
- A small early MR purchase can smooth the lane if you’re getting chunked too hard to function.

**DON’T**
- All-in like his R doesn’t exist  
- Chase after he Rs into fog  
- Fight inside W shield/stun zone

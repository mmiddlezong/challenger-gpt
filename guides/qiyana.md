# Naafiri vs Qiyana (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheatsheet (10 seconds)

### What you must respect from Qiyana
- **Q (Elemental Wrath with River element)**: her *ice* blade **roots you briefly, then slows**. If she has *river element + E up*, you’re in real danger.  
- **R (Supreme Display of Talent)**: **knockback + terrain shockwave that stuns**. If you fight near **walls / river edges / brush edges**, she can stun and one-shot.  
- **Brush element Q**: creates a **stealth field** (she can disappear mid-trade and re-angle her combo).  
- **E (Audacity)**: targeted dash that often turns into **guaranteed Q hit** (E → Q auto-aim interaction).

### Your “answers” as Naafiri
- **W (The Call of the Pack)**: **1s untargetable on cast** — this is your main outplay tool. Hold it to dodge **Qiyana R** or **river Q root**, or to deny her **E target** timing.  
- **R (Hounds’ Pursuit)**: targeted champion dash that **can’t be body-blocked** and can’t be used on minions — commit tool for punishing her mistakes.  
- **E (Eviscerate)**: short dash to reposition (mostly for *dodging* / *staying on target* after she burns mobility).

> **Rule of the matchup:** *Don’t fight Qiyana on her terms (terrain + element), and don’t spend your W “for speed” when her CC is available.*

---

## Matchup identity (who wins what)
This lane is **assassin vs assassin**, but it’s not symmetrical:

- **Qiyana is scarier in “terrain fights”** (river/jungle, wall-heavy skirmishes) because her ult can stun multiple people and instantly swing the game.
- **Naafiri is scarier in “target access”** because your R is reliable (targeted, not blockable) and your W gives a repeatable “nope” window.

Your goal is **consistency**:
- keep HP high early,
- track her roams,
- punish her *one mistake* with a clean kill/plate,
- then play fog + picks (Qiyana hates face-checking when behind).

---

## The 3 things that lose this matchup
1. **Fighting near a side wall at level 6+** (you eat R → stun → death).
2. **Letting her take river element for free** and then walking into E range.
3. **Using W casually** and having it down when she all-ins (or when junglers arrive).

If you fix those three, the lane becomes very playable.

---

## Lane plan (phase by phase)

## Levels 1–2: “Don’t donate passive procs”
Qiyana’s passive makes her first hit/trade chunk harder, and she wants short, sharp bursts.

**Your plan:**
- Start **Q** and last hit safely.
- If she walks up for an auto + Q, trade back with **Q poke** (don’t chase).
- Keep the wave **slightly closer to your side** if possible. It shortens her all-in angle and makes her roam timing worse.

**Key tell:** if Qiyana starts hovering toward river/brush, she’s usually thinking “grab element, trade.”

---

## Level 3: first real danger window
Once Qiyana has **E**, she can force interaction: **E → Q (often guaranteed) → passive proc → disengage**.

**What you do:**
- Play at a range where she has to **E through minions** (awkward angle) or commit deep.
- **Hold W** if she has *river element* or if you’re near a wall.
- Save **E** for a *sidestep dash* (don’t open with it unless you’re 100% sure you win the trade).

### Element awareness (this matters more than “HP bars”)
When she has:
- **River (ice)**: assume **E → root** is coming. Don’t step up without W.
- **Brush (grass)**: assume **stealth re-angle** is coming. Don’t waste skillshots into stealth; be ready to back up.
- **Wall (rock)**: assume **max damage / execute-style** trading. Respect if you’re below ~60% HP.

---

## Levels 4–5: stabilize and earn your first crash
You’re trying to get one clean **crash → choice**:
- ward,
- roam,
- reset.

**Do not perma-brawl**. This is where Qiyana players farm kills off ego fights.

**Best habit here:** short Q trades + wave control.
- If she uses Q on wave, you can Q her once and back off.
- If she uses W for element and doesn’t immediately fight, you can take space — but remember: **W also resets her Q**, so don’t assume she’s “low threat.”

---

## Level 6: the matchup flips on *discipline*
At 6+, both can kill. The difference is **where the fight happens**.

### Your positioning rule
- **Fight in the middle of lane**, not beside the walls.
- If you’re forced toward a wall (gank, chase, or wave state), **do not commit** unless:
  - her R is down, or
  - your W is ready and you’re specifically holding it to dodge her R.

### How you punish her at 6
You win when:
- she uses **E** aggressively and doesn’t get meaningful damage,
- she burns **R** without getting a stun,
- she roams on a bad wave and you get plates / tempo.

---

## Trading patterns (what to do, what not to do)

## The “good” Naafiri trade
1. **Q poke** (tag her, get sustain).
2. Back up 1–2 steps (deny her easy E angle).
3. If she commits: **W to dodge the key CC** → then fight.

You want trades that look “boring” but keep you healthy.

## The “bad” Naafiri trade
- E forward
- take her passive proc + E+Q
- end up near wall
- die to ignite all-in

---

## Your W usage (the whole matchup)
Treat W like a **spell-shield you control**.

### Hold W for one of these
- **Qiyana R** (best use):  
  - If you see the cast and you’re about to be knocked into terrain, **W** right before impact.  
- **River Q root** (second best use):  
  - If she has river element and you’re in E range, you’re basically playing “dodge this root.”  
- **To deny E target timing**:  
  - If she wants to E you, being untargetable can break her window.

### What not to do with W
- Don’t W “for movespeed” to poke.  
- Don’t W to start a trade unless you know she **cannot** ult you into terrain.

If you do that, she will wait out W and then kill you.

---

## Kill windows (when you should actually go for it)

### Green-light windows (70%+)
- She **used E** to trade and you sidestepped/dodged the follow-up.
- She **used river Q** and missed (or you W’d it).
- She’s forced to last-hit in front of her wave while your jungler is nearby.
- Her **R is down**, and you can fight away from walls.

### Red-light windows (coinflip)
- She has **river element + E up** and you don’t have W.
- You’re on the side of lane near wall and she has **R**.
- You’re under 60% HP and she has ignite (classic assassin threshold).

---

## Wave + roam game (don’t let her play the map)
Qiyana wants to **push and disappear**. If she gets to roam for free, she’s doing her job.

### Your anti-roam rules
- Roam only after you **crash** or on a **bounce**.
- If she roams on a bad wave:
  - **hard shove**, take a **plate**, then ward her return path.
- If you can’t match in time, don’t chase late—get guaranteed value.

### Simple ward plan vs Qiyana
- Early: ward one side river/raptors **around first crash window**.
- Mid game: control ward the **side she roams toward** and play fog yourself.

---

## Mid game and fights (where each champ wants to play)

### Where Qiyana is strongest
- jungle corridors
- dragon setups in river
- walls everywhere

### Where Naafiri is strongest
- picks from fog
- catching side waves then disappearing
- punishing squishies rotating without vision

**Practical rule:** if you must fight an objective, arrive early and set vision.
If you’re walking into river blind, you’re walking into Qiyana’s best scenario.

---

## Item + summoner adjustments (consistency picks)

### Summoners
- **Ignite** if you’re confident and want kill threat.
- **Exhaust** is extremely consistent into Qiyana burst if you’re struggling (it turns her “one rotation kill” into “she has to outplay twice”).

### Early buys (choose based on how lane is going)
- If you’re getting chunked: a small **early armor** component can stabilize you.
- If you’re stable/ahead: keep your damage curve so she can’t roam freely.

*(Exact best-in-slot items shift patch to patch, but the concept doesn’t: survive the first burst, then keep tempo.)*

## Common mistakes and fixes

### “I died to ult near a wall”
**Fix:** fight in lane center; if you’re forced near wall, hold W specifically for R.

### “I got rooted and one-shot”
**Fix:** track her element. If she has river element, assume she is fishing for root and don’t step into E range without W.

### “I used W and then she killed me”
**Fix:** W is not a “speed button” in this matchup — it’s your anti-CC window.

### “She roamed and I lost the game”
**Fix:** crash → ward or crash → punish plates. Don’t follow late.

---

## 15-second pre-fight checklist
Before any fight/skirmish, ask:
1. **Which element does Qiyana hold?** (river = root, brush = stealth, wall = damage)
2. **Is her R up?** If yes, am I near terrain?
3. **Is my W up?** If no, am I about to take a risky trade?
4. **Do I have a wave crash/tempo reason to leave lane?**

If you keep that loop, you’ll stop coinflipping and start winning the matchup through discipline.

# Naafiri Mid vs Malzahar — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes** (especially **no deaths to R + jungle gank**)
- Don’t waste commits into **Void Shift (passive)** and then get suppressed
- Get out of the “mid lane prison” by using **crash → roam/ward/reset** windows
- In midgame fights: play **flank + pick** and force Malz R onto *someone else*

This is an **anti-assassin** matchup. You don’t “outplay” Malzahar’s point-and-click ultimate consistently in a clean 1v1. You win by **tempo, wave control, and team play**.

---

## Why this matchup is hard (what you’re really fighting)
Malzahar’s kit is designed to shut down assassins:
- **Passive (Void Shift):** if he hasn’t been hit recently, he gets **massive damage reduction + CC immunity**. Your burst gets “deleted” until you pop it.
- **E (Malefic Visions) + W (Voidlings):** he can perma-push and make you farm under tower.
- **R (Nether Grasp):** point-and-click **suppression**. If you’re in range and his jungler is nearby, you can die even if you “did nothing wrong.”

So your core plan is:
> “Pop passive safely, don’t stand in R range with no info, and use wave crashes to move first.”

---

## Non‑negotiable rules (follow these and you stop bleeding games)
### Rule 1 — Never commit into Void Shift
If his passive shield is up, your all-in is usually wasted.
You need to **break it first** (Q poke / quick hit / short trade), then look for real damage.

**Simple habit:** Before any big commit (R/E forward), ask: “Did I pop his passive?”

---

### Rule 2 — After level 6, assume: “If I’m in R range and jungle is missing, I’m dead”
Most “I hate Malzahar” losses are actually:
- wave is in a bad spot,
- you step up to last-hit,
- Malz presses R,
- jungler appears,
- you die with no counterplay.

So your defensive rule is not mechanical — it’s positional:
- keep the wave **short** (toward your side)
- play on the **warded side**
- don’t walk up when you don’t know where the jungler is

---

### Rule 3 — Your W is not for tempo in this matchup
Naafiri W (untargetable) is your emergency answer to:
- “I’m about to get ulted”
- “I’m about to get ganked”
- “I must cross a dangerous zone”

If you W just to run faster in lane, you’re often left with no answer when the real threat happens.

---

### Rule 4 — Kill Voidlings or the lane becomes unplayable
If you let Voidlings live, Malz will:
- push faster than you,
- force you under tower,
- and open you to gank + R setups.

When he summons Voidlings:
- **thin them immediately** (Q + autos where safe)
- don’t stand in the middle of them while eating E/Q poke

---

### Rule 5 — Don’t try to “win trades.” Win *tempo*.
Malzahar is happy to trade HP if he gets:
- wave control,
- plate damage,
- jungle setup,
- or a free roam timer.

Your priority is: **stable HP + wave state + map actions**.

---

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)

### Levels 1–2: stabilize + don’t donate passive value
- Farm calmly.
- If you can pop his passive with a safe Q/hit, do it — but don’t overextend for it.
- Keep wave from being permanently shoved into you for free.

**Win condition:** reach level 3 with enough HP and wave control to choose your recalls/wards.

---

### Levels 3–5: “pop passive → short trade” only
Your best lane interaction is:
1) pop passive safely,
2) short trade (Q poke / quick burst),
3) back off.

Don’t chase through his wave. Don’t get stuck in his E + Voidlings zone.

**If he perma-shoves:** your response is not “fight him,” it’s:
- thin the wave,
- keep HP high,
- and plan a crash/reset so you don’t get stuck under tower forever.

---

### Level 6+: the matchup shifts hard
From 6 onward:
- your solo kill threat drops
- his kill threat spikes (especially with jungler)

So your goal becomes:
- **don’t stand in R range without info**
- **crash → roam/ward/reset**
- coordinate with your jungler: Malz is immobile and punishable if passive is popped and R is baited.

---

## Trading rules (what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed)

### Allowed (repeatable, low risk)
- **Q poke to break passive**, then back off
- Short burst trades when his passive is down and wave is safe
- Crash wave → roam/ward/reset (your best “wins”)
- Call jungler when:
  - passive is popped,
  - wave is on your side,
  - Malz is overextended

### Forbidden (classic Naafiri throw patterns)
- R/E all-in while passive is up
- Stepping into R range with no jungle info
- Fighting inside his Voidlings + E zone
- Trying to dive him 1v1 after 6 (you’ll get suppressed)

---

## How to actually beat Malzahar (the practical win plan)

### 1) Use crash windows to leave lane
Malz wants you stuck mid catching waves.
You want to:
- crash a wave
- disappear into fog
- help your jungler / side lane
- come back before you lose too much

Even if you don’t get a kill, you win by:
- forcing Malz to choose between plates and matching
- getting vision and control for objectives

---

### 2) Play with your jungler (this is the “answer” to Malz)
The clean punish pattern is:
- pop passive first
- force him to use R on someone (often your jungler)
- you punish his immobility during/after the channel

You generally don’t need to “outplay” Malz — you need **numbers**.

---

### 3) Midgame fights: don’t be the guy Malz ults
If you’re the only diver and you show first, Malz will hold R for you.

Your best approach:
- come from fog/flank
- don’t be the first champion in vision
- wait for Malz to show R (even on someone else)
- then you commit onto carries

**Goal:** Malz ults your frontline/jungler → you kill his backline.

---

## Common death patterns (and the fix)

1) **“I walked up for CS and got R+ganked”**  
   Fix: wave toward you, warded side, don’t step into R range when jungle is missing.

2) **“I all-ined and did no damage”**  
   Fix: you didn’t pop passive first. Pop it, then trade.

3) **“I’m perma under tower and lose plates”**  
   Fix: kill Voidlings faster; plan crash → reset so you return with tempo/HP.

4) **“I tried to force a solo kill after 6”**  
   Fix: this isn’t that matchup. Roam, play with jungler, or pick others.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Pop passive first. After 6, respect R + jungle. Kill Voidlings. Crash and roam. Don’t be first into vision in fights.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track ONLY these 3 things:

1) **Passive discipline:** Did I ever commit (R/E forward) while Void Shift was up? (Y/N)  
   Target: **No in 8/10 games**

2) **Ult deaths:** How many deaths were “Malz R + jungle”?  
   Target: trending toward **0**

3) **Tempo actions:** After every successful crash, did I do *one* action (ward/roam/reset) instead of hovering mid? (Y/N)  
   Target: **Yes in 7/10 games**

If you nail these, Malzahar stops feeling like “impossible,” and starts feeling like “annoying but beatable.”

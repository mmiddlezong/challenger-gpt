# Naafiri Mid vs Brand — tempo assassin matchup guide

## Spell snapshot (read this first)

### Brand (what you must avoid)
- **Q (Sear):** skillshot **stun** *only if you’re Ablaze* (hit by any Brand spell recently). If you get tagged by a spell, **expect Q next**.
- **W (Pillar of Flame):** delayed AoE poke + waveclear. If you get hit while Ablaze, it hurts a lot more.
- **E (Conflagration):** point-and-click damage; can **spread** in a burning wave/clump (don’t stand glued to your minions when they’re on fire).
- **R (Pyroclasm):** bouncing ult; if you’re Ablaze it can **slow**. Brand is strongest when you fight **in a minion wave / clumped team**.

### Naafiri (your tools into Brand)
- **W (The Call of the Pack):** your **1s untargetable** timing tool. Save it to deny **Brand Q stun** (and to dodge follow-up damage), not just for movespeed.
- **R (Hounds’ Pursuit):** champion-only **commit**. Use it when Q is down/missed, or when you can W-dodge it.

---

## Matchup identity (how you win)
Brand’s lane goal is simple: **shove + poke until you’re too low to threaten**, then control river with prio.  
Your lane goal is also simple: **stay healthy → get a clean crash → take a guaranteed tempo action (ward/roam/reset)**. You don’t have to “win CS” early—you have to **create threat** so Brand can’t play the map freely.

---

## Setup that makes the lane consistent

### Starting items
- **Doran’s Shield** + potion is the default (it buys you lane HP for your first tempo window).
- **Refillable** on first reset is great if you’re taking repeated poke.

### Rune/secondary goals (not a full rune page)
Prioritize:
- **sustain vs poke** (so you don’t get forced out before level 6)
- **tenacity / anti-stun comfort** if the enemy team has other CC
- **burst + move speed** to convert level 6 kills into plates

### Early buys (simple rule)
If you’re getting chunked:
- grab **early MR** (Null-Magic Mantle) *or* an **anti-burst component** and go back to your normal damage curve.
If you’re stable:
- rush your normal **lethality spike** and play for 6 + roams.

---

## Lane plan (phase-by-phase)

## Levels 1–3: “Don’t get stunned for free”
**Rule #1:** stay behind minions. Brand Q is blockable, and his stun requires you to be Ablaze.

**What good looks like**
- Last hit with Q when needed, and take only “free” poke (Q tag when Brand walks up to last hit).
- If Brand is hitting you *and* the wave at the same time with W, you’re standing too close to the center of the wave.

**What to avoid**
- Taking a random W hit → becoming Ablaze → eating Q stun → losing half your HP.  
If you get clipped by a spell, instantly switch to “don’t get Q’d” mode for the next couple seconds.

---

## Levels 3–5: “Create a crash → earn a choice”
Brand wants permanent shove. You want **one clean crash** that lets you do something guaranteed.

**Your crash options (in order of consistency):**
1) **Reset** (buy + return with HP/tempo)  
2) **Ward/track** (raptors / river entrance based on junglers)  
3) **Roam with your jungler** (numbers play, not solo-guessing)  
4) **Plate** (only if you know where the enemy jungler is)

**Assassin rule for roams (use this every game):**
Roam only when you **crashed** (or are about to crash) and your roam decision happens within **~20 seconds**.

---

## Level 6+: “Brand’s mistakes become kills”
Brand is immobile. If his Q is down or he misses it, he’s extremely punishable.

**Real kill window checklist**
- You’re not starting at 50% HP
- Brand **missed Q** or used it on wave  
- You have a lane state that won’t punish you (neutral/crashed wave)
- You know where the enemy jungler is (or you can leave after)

**Discipline tip:** if you can’t answer “what happens in the next 10 seconds after I R?”, don’t R.

---

## The matchup “rules” that decide the lane

### 1) Never all-in while you’re Ablaze (unless you’re forcing a guaranteed kill)
If Brand hit you with anything, assume **Q stun is being aimed at you**.  
Your job is to either:
- **sidestep** Q (easier when you’re not slowed / not panicking), or
- **W** specifically to deny the stun timing.

### 2) Don’t stand in burning waves
If Brand W’s the wave and starts spreading fire, don’t sit inside your casters.  
Brand loves E spreading and W hitting both you + wave.

### 3) Hold W for the “one spell that matters”
In this matchup, the spell that matters is usually:
- **Brand Q** (because stun = you lose trade / die to follow-up)

Use W like a repeatable outplay window:
- *wait* → Brand throws Q → **W** → then commit (or disengage).

### 4) Fight with your pack alive
Brand’s AoE constantly “cleans” your packmates. If your dogs are dead, your damage and threat drop.
Before you commit:
- take 2–3 seconds to let packmates return, or
- use **W/E** to stabilize pack positioning before you R in.

## First 6 waves: a concrete lane script

**Wave 1**
- Last hit only. Keep HP high. Stay behind minions.
- If Brand starts W for push: let it happen; don’t contest with your face.

**Wave 2**
- Thin the wave with Q so it doesn’t crash as a massive stack.
- Stand *slightly* off to the side of your ranged minions to reduce W value.

**Wave 3 (first real tempo window)**
- If you’re healthy: help the wave crash **cleanly** → **reset or ward**.
- If you’re not healthy: let it come in, farm under tower, and reset on a safer wave.

**Wave 4–5**
- Look for short trades when Brand uses W on wave or misses Q.
- If you can’t interact safely, prioritize the “crash → reset” loop.

**Wave 6**
- If you’re stable and Brand is careless with Q: threaten R.
- If Brand is disciplined: crash + move first with jungler; punish side lanes instead of forcing mid.

---

## Trading patterns (simple, repeatable)

### Safe poke trade (your default)
- Q for last hits → tag Brand when he steps up → back behind minions  
Goal: stay high HP, keep lane stable.

### “Q missed = punish” trade
When Brand **misses Q**:
- step up, take a heavier trade, then back off before his next cooldown cycle.
You’re not obligated to full-send without R—just take the HP advantage and set up your next crash.

### All-in idea (not a combo sheet)
Your cleanest all-ins usually look like:
- approach from an angle (not straight through the wave)
- **hold W for Q**
- commit with **R** only when you know you can either kill or exit

---

## Vision & jungle interaction (how you actually carry)

### Where to ward vs Brand shove
- If Brand perma-pushes, he invites jungler pathing mid.  
Ward based on jungler location:
- **Raptor entrance / river pixel** when you expect mid pressure.
- **One deep ward after a crash** is better than dying with a ward in inventory.

### How you win the map
Your win condition is **mid prio into numbers plays**:
- crash → move with jungler for raptors/river fights
- collapse on sides when Brand is stuck clearing
- set up fog near objectives so someone face-checks and dies

---

## Mid game plan (where Naafiri takes over)

### Stop living mid
Your best loop:
1) catch wave
2) push
3) disappear into fog
4) pick someone rotating late
5) take objective / tower

### Objective setup (assassin style)
Be in river/jungle **45–60s before** dragon/herald/baron:
- push mid first
- then go dark with control ward
- punish the first person who tries to get vision

Brand hates moving into fog without teammates—make him do it.

---

## Teamfights vs Brand (don’t suicide into AoE)
Brand is strongest in **clumped fights**. You are strongest on **flanks + picks**.

**Enter fights like this:**
- come from the side
- wait for Brand Q to be thrown (or bait it)
- **W** the key moment if needed
- delete a carry (or Brand himself if he’s the damage engine)
- then leave or chain with your reset/recast opportunities

**Don’t:**
- R first into 5 people
- dive into minion waves + Brand R bounces
- stand on your team and eat AoE together

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** you eat one spell and keep walking forward → get Q stunned  
  **Fix:** once you’re Ablaze, your entire job is “don’t get Q’d” for the next seconds.

- **Mistake:** you W for speed and have nothing for Q  
  **Fix:** W is your anti-stun timing tool first.

- **Mistake:** you roam on a bad wave and lose 2 waves + plate  
  **Fix:** roam only on crash/bounce; otherwise reset.

- **Mistake:** you kill Brand and then do nothing  
  **Fix:** take a plate, take mid tower, or take an objective—convert.

---

## Quick decision checklist (use after every crash)
1) Where is the enemy jungler likely?
2) Do I have a **70%+** roam (setup + wave + vision)?
3) If not, can I ward/invade safely with my jungler?
4) If none, do I reset and repeat the loop?

---

## Mini practice plan (5 games)
- **Game focus:** hold W for Brand Q every fight cycle  
  Review: did you W too early, or did you W exactly for Q?

- **Game focus:** crash-and-choose  
  Review: after every crash, did you **ward/roam/reset** immediately?

- **Game focus:** R discipline  
  Review: every R—could you explain your next 10 seconds (kill/exit/second target)?

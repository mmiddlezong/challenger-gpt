# Naafiri Mid vs Vex — Matchup Guide

## Vex spells (what to respect, what can CC you)

- **Passive — Doom 'n Gloom**
  - **Doom (HARD CC):** when Doom is up, Vex’s next basic ability **FEARS** and **interrupts dashes**.  
    **You must avoid dashing in while Doom is ready.**
  - **Gloom (anti-dash punish):** when you **dash/blink**, you get marked. Vex can **consume the mark** for extra damage and faster Doom uptime.  
    **Every Naafiri E/R is “taxed” by Gloom—only dash when the trade is winning.**

- **Q — Mistral Bolt (poke + waveclear)**
  - Main lane poke tool. If you eat repeated Qs, you’ll lose lane by HP and be forced to base on bad timers.

- **W — Personal Space (shield + close-range burst)**
  - Instant **shield** + AoE damage around her. If Doom is up, W range can become a “get off me” fear zone.  
  - **Avoid committing point-blank** unless Doom is down or you have lethal.

- **E — Looming Darkness (setup CC-lite)**
  - AoE damage + **SLOW**. This is how she makes Q guaranteed and sets up R or jungle ganks.  
  - **Avoid getting clipped by E in the middle of the lane** (it usually starts her winning trade).

- **R — Shadow Surge (long-range pick + resets)**
  - Long-range projectile. If it hits, she can **dash to you** and often chain kills/resets.
  - **Avoid staying low HP in lane with no vision.** You can get R’d from fog and die even if you were “winning lane.”

## Matchup summary (the real game plan)

**What Vex wants:** poke you down, hold Doom to punish your engage, shove waves safely, and punish roams with R follow.  
**What you want:** keep HP stable early, **track Doom**, create clean crash timers, roam with tempo, and only all-in when Doom is down.

**Win conditions for Naafiri:**
1. **Survive early poke without losing tempo** (good recalls, minimal bad trades).
2. **Bait Doom** (or force it onto the wave) → **then** threaten kill/gank.
3. Convert kills into **plates/mid tower** (mid tower unlocks your fog picks).
4. Mid game: play from **side + fog**, punish rotations, avoid front-to-back 5v5 where Vex can fear divers.

**Lose conditions:**
- You dash in while Doom is up and get feared → you lose 70% HP or die.
- You get chunked by Q/E and are forced into bad recalls (lose waves/plates).
- You roam on a bad wave and Vex instantly shoves/takes plates.
- You group mid and take a straight 5v5 with no flank angle (Vex loves this).

## The #1 skill in this matchup: Doom tracking

Before you press **E** or **R**, ask:

> “Is Doom up right now?”

**If Doom is up:** you generally **do not dash in** unless:
- Vex is already committed to something else,
- you have a guaranteed kill (ignite + low HP),
- or you can force her Doom ability to miss (timed W untargetable) and still win.

**If Doom is down:** you have a real threat window.
- This is when you can walk up, trade, call your jungler, or look for an all-in.

**How to bait Doom:**
- Step just into “threat range” so she throws Q/E at you, then sidestep.
- Let her use a spell to thin the wave under tower.
- Force her to panic-cast W defensively (often happens when she thinks you’ll commit).

---

## Lane plan (by levels)

### Levels 1–2: “Farm, don’t bleed HP”
**Goal:** arrive to level 3 with good HP and a playable wave state.

- Stand slightly off-center so Q doesn’t hit you + the wave for free.
- Last-hit safely (your Q can help secure CS without walking into poke).
- Do **not** take repeated autos trying to “win trade” early—Vex wins attrition.

**Checkpoint:** If you’re below ~70% HP at level 2 without a clear advantage, you’re playing into her win condition.

---

### Levels 3–5: “Stabilize wave and force a crash timer”
You’re looking for one of two states:

1) **Freeze / hold near your side** (best if you’re being poked)  
- Vex has to walk up to break it → more gank angles for your jungler.
- You also reduce the distance you must travel to disengage after a bad trade.

2) **Slow push → crash** (best when you’re healthy and Doom is down)  
- Crash gives you a “choice window”: ward, reset, roam, or hover for your jungler.

**Trading rules:**
- **Never E forward** just to “start a trade.” Use E primarily to dodge E/Q or finish kills.
- Chip with Q when she walks up for last hits, but don’t eat Q/E in return.

**Jungle note:** Vex is much easier to gank when Doom is down. Ping your jungler when you see Doom used.

---

### Level 6+: “All-in only on the right cooldown window”
Your kills usually require at least one of:
- Doom down,
- her W already used,
- her E missed/used on wave,
- her Flash down,
- you have jungler nearby.

**A practical all-in pattern:**
1. Chip her to ~70% or lower with Q poke / short trades.
2. Wait for Doom to be used (or clearly down).
3. Use **W** reactively (to dodge the spell that would stop you), not just for speed.
4. Commit with **R** when you have a clean line and follow-up.

**If you R while Doom is up**, you’re often just delivering yourself into fear + burst.

## Micro: trading & “don’t get owned” rules

### What you want (short, repeatable wins)
- **Q poke** when she goes for CS.
- Back off before she can land E → Q.
- Hold E for dodge; hold W for “I’m about to be stopped.”

### What you must avoid
- **Dashing first** while Doom is ready.
- Taking E slow in the open lane (it sets up everything).
- Standing close enough that W hits you for free.
- Taking a long fight: Vex is designed to punish repeated dashes/engage attempts.

### Using Naafiri W correctly in this matchup
Think of W as:
- a **dodge window** (untargetable timing vs her “stop button”),
- and a **commit amplifier** only when you already have the right angle.

If you W too early, Vex waits and fears you after you reappear.

## Wave management & roaming (how to win the map without inting lane)

### Roam checklist vs Vex
Only roam when:
- You **crashed a wave** (or the wave is bouncing back to you),
- You have **vision** to protect your exit route,
- The roam is likely to be decided quickly (bot is fighting, top is diveable, etc.).

Don’t roam when:
- You’re leaving a slow push for Vex to farm + plate for free,
- Vex has R and your side lanes are low HP (she can counter-roam hard),
- You’re low and could get tagged by R from fog.

### The “anti-Vex” roam style
- Crash wave → go dark for 5–10 seconds (threaten) → if nothing is free, reset.
- You don’t have to force a roam; you just need to force her to *respect* it.

---

## Jungle interaction (your gank setup and how to not get 2v2’d)

### Your best gank window
- Doom is down.
- Wave is closer to your side.
- Vex just used E or Q on wave.

**Your job:** don’t start the fight with a dash. Walk up, threaten, then dash after her response.

### Their best counterplay
- Vex holds Doom and turns on your jungler when they enter.
- Enemy jungler shows up during your all-in and you’re feared in the open lane.

**Discipline rule:** If you don’t know where the enemy jungler is, you don’t get to “hard commit” into Vex with Doom up.

---

## Mid game plan (where Naafiri can outperform Vex)

### Side lane + fog > ARAM mid
Vex is excellent at:
- standing mid,
- clearing waves,
- threatening R picks,
- punishing divers in grouped fights.

You’re better at:
- **side-lane pressure**, then disappearing into fog,
- killing people who face-check,
- punishing rotations between lanes/objectives.

### How to play objectives vs Vex
- Arrive early, control a flank angle, and wait.
- You’re hunting the person who walks in late to ward.
- Avoid entering through the obvious choke where Vex can fear multiple divers.

---

## Teamfights (how to not get feared and deleted)

**Your role:** flank + cleanup, not first engage.

### Fight entry rules
- If Doom is up: you wait.
- If Vex has already used her fear (or you see it hit someone else): you can look to commit.
- Try to make Vex choose: “peel my carry” vs “save myself.”

### Targeting priorities
1. ADC / immobile carry (if you can reach without being instantly feared)
2. Vex herself (if she’s isolated and Doom is down)
3. Enchanter / low-mobility support

### What winning looks like
- Vex uses fear on someone else or whiffs.
- You come in from side, get a kill, then reposition.
- Your team takes objective off the pick.

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** “I dashed in to trade while Doom was up.”  
  **Fix:** Track Doom. No dash-in trades unless Doom is down or you have lethal.

- **Mistake:** “I roamed on a bad wave and lost 2 plates.”  
  **Fix:** Roam only after crash/bounce. If you can’t crash, reset or hold.

- **Mistake:** “I got hit by E slow and lost the whole trade.”  
  **Fix:** Play lateral movement, stand outside E angles, hold E to dodge.

- **Mistake:** “I stayed low mid with no vision and got R’d.”  
  **Fix:** Respect R threat. Reset earlier and keep river/jungle warded.

## Learning objectives (focus 5–10 games)

### Objective A — Doom discipline
- In every lane trade, **say out loud** (or in your head): “Doom up/down.”
- Goal: **0 deaths** from dashing in while Doom is up across 5 games.

### Objective B — HP management
- Goal: be **≥70% HP** at level 3 in at least 4 of the next 5 games.
- Track: “How many Qs did I take for free?”

### Objective C — Roam quality
- Only roam after a crash/bounce.
- Goal: **No roams that cost you more than 6 minions or a plate**.

### Objective D — W timing
- Goal: use W to dodge or negate the “stop spell” at least **once per game** (fear window).
- Review: Was W used proactively (bad) or reactively vs a key spell (good)?

### Quick VOD review questions
- What wave was I on when I took my first bad base?
- Did I ever E/R in while Doom was clearly available?
- Did I create at least one clean crash timer before 10 minutes?
- Did I die to an R pick because I stayed low with no vision?

## One-page cheat sheet

- **Don’t dash in while Doom is up.**
- **Avoid E slow in open lane.**
- **Crash waves before roaming.**
- **Hold W for the spell that stops you.**
- **Mid game: side lane + fog picks, not ARAM.**

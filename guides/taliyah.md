# Naafiri vs Taliyah (Mid) — Matchup Guide
*Tempo assassin vs anti-dash control mage*

---

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first)
### What you **must** respect from Taliyah
- **W — Seismic Shove (CC / displacement):** Ground-targeted knock/throw. If it hits, she can **reposition you** into bad spots (especially into **E**).
- **E — Unraveled Earth (anti-dash + CC):** Creates a slowing minefield. **If you dash through it OR get shoved/knocked through it, the mines explode and STUN you.**  
  **This is the #1 thing that punishes Naafiri. Do not E/R through it.**
- **Q — Threaded Volley (poke + wave control):** Long-range poke/waveclear while she can still move. If you eat full Qs, you’ll never have an all-in.
- **R — Weaver’s Wall (trap/roam tool):** Cuts off exits and accelerates roams. If she walls you + your escape path, you can get forced into W/E follow-up.

### Your tools that win the matchup
- **W — The Call of the Pack (1s untargetable):** Your **anti-W button**. Hold it to dodge the shove (or deny follow-up target lock). Don’t waste it just for move speed.
- **Q — Darkin Daggers (lane sustain + chip):** Your “stay healthy” tool. You win by arriving to level 6 with HP and tempo.
- **E — Eviscerate (dash):** **Never dash through Unraveled Earth.** Use E to **sidestep** or finish **after** E is gone.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit (targeted commit):** Reliable engage (not body-blockable), but it’s still a **dash** — so it’s dangerous if her **E is down** on the path.

## Matchup identity (what you’re really doing)
Taliyah is one of the best *anti-assassin* mids because she:
- controls the wave with Q,
- punishes dashes with E,
- and turns one W hit into lethal setups.

So your plan is **not** “all-in whenever I’m level 3.”  
Your plan is:

> **Stay high HP → manage wave so she can’t roam freely → punish missed/used W or E → hit level 6 → convert one clean kill/roam into plates and map control.**

---

## The 3 rules that decide this lane
1. **If Taliyah E is on the ground, your E/R are “off limits.”** Walk, kite, wait, or change angle.
2. **Hold Naafiri W for Taliyah W.** If you W-dodge the shove, her kill pressure and gank setup collapse.
3. **Tempo beats trading.** Good crashes + good resets beat “random fights” into an anti-dash mage.

---

## Lane plan: phase by phase

## Levels 1–2: survive poke, don’t donate HP
**Taliyah’s goal:** shove with Q, poke you while you last-hit.  
**Your goal:** take clean CS and keep HP high.

**Do:**
- Stand **slightly to the side** of the wave so you can sidestep Threaded Volley.
- Last-hit with **Q** when you’d otherwise eat a full Q from her.
- Let the wave lean **toward you** if she’s perma-Q’ing.

**Don’t:**
- Take “one extra melee minion” at the cost of 30–40% HP.
- Walk in a straight line at her while she Qs.

### Early start suggestions (simple)
- **Doran’s Shield** if you expect constant Q poke or you’re learning the matchup.
- **Long Sword start** if you’re confident you can keep HP high and want faster kill pressure.

---

## Levels 3–5: respect W+E, trade only on windows
At level 3, Taliyah can threaten **E zone → W displacement** (or W → E follow-up depending on spacing).  
Your job is to create **predictable windows**:

### Your best trade window
- **She uses W and misses** (or uses it on the wave).
- OR she **uses E defensively** and it expires.
- OR she’s overextended with no jungle help.

### Your default trade pattern (safe & repeatable)
1. **Q poke** when she steps up (especially when she’s using Q on wave).
2. Back up, let bleed tick.
3. **Q pop** if safe.
4. Keep **E** for dodging/escaping, not as your opener.

> If she’s holding W, you are playing a *poke + wave* lane, not a dash lane.

---

## Level 6+: kill windows exist, but only if you’re disciplined
Naafiri R is a commit. Into Taliyah, a “real” all-in usually requires:

✅ **Her E is down** (best)  
or  
✅ You can **R from an angle** that doesn’t cross E, and you have W ready for shove  
plus at least one of:
- she’s missing Flash,
- she’s already chunked,
- your jungler is nearby,
- your wave state won’t punish you (crashed/neutral).

If those aren’t true, your level 6 value is often:
- **crash → roam**, or
- **crash → ward + reset**, or
- **hold R to punish her roam path.**

---

# First 6 waves: a concrete lane script (most games)
*(Adapt if your jungler invades / you get early skirmishes.)*

### Wave 1
- **Last-hit only.** Let Taliyah push if she wants.
- Stand **off-angle** from the wave to dodge Q directionally.
- Use Q to secure CS you’d otherwise lose to poke.

### Wave 2
- Keep the wave **slightly on your side** (safe lane position).
- If she uses Q on wave, you may tag her with Q **only if** you won’t eat W+auto+Q in return.

### Wave 3 (you hit level 3)
- **This is the danger point.** Respect W+E.
- Keep **W ready** to dodge Seismic Shove.
- Do **not** E forward unless her E is unavailable and W is already used.

### 2:30–3:15 ward timing (standard)
- If you’re on the side that the enemy jungler can gank through (raptor/river), drop a ward **before** you get shoved off the wave.  
- If you’re being pushed in, a **pixel brush** ward is fine. If you have prio, ward deeper (raptor entrance / river bend).

### Wave 4–5: earn a crash
- Thin with Q so the wave doesn’t freeze on her side.
- Try to build a **bigger wave** and **crash** it.
- On crash, pick **one**: ward, roam, reset. (Don’t stand mid doing nothing.)

### Wave 6
- Return with items/HP and look for either:
  - a **map play** (roam with jungler), or
  - a **punish** if she wastes W or E.

## How to actually all-in Taliyah (the safe checklist)
Before you press R, quickly check:

1. **Is E on the ground?**  
   - If yes, can I engage from an angle that doesn’t cross it (or wait it out)?
2. **Do I have W ready?**  
   - If no, don’t R. Her shove decides fights.
3. **Where is her escape path?**  
   - If she can retreat under tower while you’re slowed by E, you’re coinflipping.
4. **Can I exit if it doesn’t instantly kill?**  
   - E to reposition, second R on takedown, or teammates.

### One clean execution pattern
- Walk into range **without dashing**.
- **Hold W** and watch for her W animation/zone.
- If she uses W: **W (untargetable)** to dodge it.
- Then **R commit** when she’s exposed / E is down / or you have angle.
- Use **E** to reposition after she tries to kite.

## Ganks & 2v2s (how to win skirmishes)
Taliyah is gankable because she often pushes — but she’s also *hard to gank* if W+E are up.

### Ask your jungler to gank when:
- Taliyah **just used W** (missed or used on wave).
- Taliyah uses **E aggressively** and it’s on cooldown.
- She’s pushed past river with no vision support.

### Your job in ganks
- Don’t rush your dash through E.
- Be the finisher: **Q chip → hold W to dodge shove → R when she’s committed**.

---

## Mid game: your real win condition vs Taliyah
Once plates fall, Taliyah wants to:
- clear mid fast,
- move first with passive + R,
- and control objectives with E zones.

You beat that by:
- pushing a wave,
- disappearing into fog,
- and threatening picks on rotations (supports/ADC moving to ward).

### Objective setup rule
**Arrive 45–60s early**, push mid, then go dark in river/jungle.  
If you show mid at dragon spawn, Taliyah gets to set up E/W zones for free.

---

## Teamfights: don’t dash into the minefield
Taliyah is at her best when she can place **E** between you and her carries.

**Your fight plan:**
- Approach from side angles (river/jungle), not straight through mid.
- Wait for her to cast **E** in the “obvious” choke.
- Either:
  - go around it, or
  - wait it out, then commit.
- Hold W to dodge shove, then kill a squishy and leave.

---

## Items & boots (practical, matchup-focused)
*(Exact builds change patch to patch — these are principles.)*

### Boots
- **Mercury’s Treads**: great if you’re getting CC’d and bursted (tenacity helps vs stun from E triggers).
- Damage boots are fine if you’re ahead, but don’t be greedy if you’re dying to one combo.

### Anti-Taliyah tech choices
- **Edge of Night** (spell shield): strong for blocking **Seismic Shove** and turning her combo off.
- **Maw of Malmortius** (MR + lifeline): good if she’s the main magic damage threat and bursting you.

### Core mindset
If you can’t kill her cleanly, your gold value is often:
- **move speed + tempo** (to roam and pick),
- **survivability vs burst** (so you can threaten fog without instantly dying).

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)
- **Mistake:** R/E through Unraveled Earth and get stunned.  
  **Fix:** Treat E on the ground as “no dash zone.” Walk out / go around / wait.

- **Mistake:** W for move speed, then eat shove.  
  **Fix:** Hold W to dodge **Seismic Shove** first; everything else second.

- **Mistake:** Forcing all-ins while low HP from Q poke.  
  **Fix:** Win early lane by staying healthy. Your assassin power comes from being *able* to threaten, not from flipping.

- **Mistake:** Matching her roam late.  
  **Fix:** Either match immediately on a crashed wave, or hard shove and take plates/vision. Don’t do the “arrive late + lose wave” double loss.

---

## 10-second in-game checklist
When you’re unsure what to do:
1. **Is the wave crashed or about to crash?** If yes → roam/ward/reset.
2. **Is Taliyah W down?** If yes → you can trade more aggressively.
3. **Is Taliyah E down?** If yes → you can consider R commit.
4. **No window?** Farm with Q, stay healthy, play tempo.

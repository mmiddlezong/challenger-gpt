# Naafiri Mid vs Aurora — Matchup Guide

## Aurora spell cheat sheet (what to respect)

**Passive — Spirit Abjuration (sustain + %HP poke)**  
- Every **3rd** spell/attack on you procs bonus **% max HP magic damage** and creates spirits that **heal** Aurora for a few seconds.  
- **What to avoid:** long, repeated trades where she gets multiple 3-hit procs for free.

**Q — Twofold Hex (long-range poke + “execute-y” return)**  
- Fires a long-range missile that **curses** on hit. She can **recast** to pull the curse back toward herself, dealing damage that scales with your **missing HP**.  
- **What to avoid:** getting tagged by Q when you’re already chunked (Q2 can spike you hard).

**W — Across the Veil (hop + invis)**  
- Short hop, then **invisibility** + **move speed**. Resets on takedown (so in skirmishes she can chain it).  
- **What to avoid:** committing your full combo while W is up (you may lose target / she slips out).

**E — The Weirding (main peel) — *SLOW***  
- AoE blast that **slows** (decaying) and then Aurora **hops backward**.  
- **What to avoid:** dashing in **before** she uses E; it’s her best “nope” button vs assassins.

**R — Between Worlds (zone control) — *SLOW + mobility zone***  
- Leap + pulse that **slows**, then creates a zone where Aurora can **teleport/jump edge-to-edge**. Crossing the boundary causes a **heavy slow**.  
- **What to avoid:** chasing her through the zone/edge mechanics. If she ults defensively, you usually disengage and re-engage after it ends.

> **Bottom line:** Aurora has **slows**, **invisibility**, and **multiple disengages**. You win by *cooldown discipline* and *burst windows*, not by “always all-in”.

## Matchup identity (what each champ wants)

### Aurora wants:
- To **poke you down** with Q and E, then threaten lethal with Q2 missing-HP damage.
- To **kite** your all-ins using E hop-back, W invis, and R zone.
- To turn skirmishes where she can get **takedown → W reset**.

### Naafiri wants:
- To **stay healthy**, avoid getting chipped into Q2 range, and keep waves in positions that reduce her free poke.
- To **force short, high-damage trades** after Aurora burns her defensive tools (E/W).
- To **roam and snowball** side lanes once you have level 6+ kill threat.

---

## Your win conditions vs Aurora

1. **Don’t lose lane to chip damage.** If you’re above ~70% HP most of lane, her “Q tag → Q2 chunk” pattern is way less scary.
2. **Punish E usage.** If Aurora uses **E to hit wave**, she temporarily loses her best self-peel. That’s your window to step up.
3. **Roam when she’s slippery.** Many Auroras will not die 1v1 if they hold W/E. If the kill isn’t clean, **crash wave and roam** instead of flipping.
4. **Teamfight by flanking, not front-to-back chasing.** Aurora’s R is designed to punish straight-line pursuit.

---

## Laning plan (phase-by-phase)

### Levels 1–2: “HP preservation > ego trades”
- **Last-hit first, trade second.** Your #1 job is to not get poked for free.
- Stand **slightly off-center** of the minion wave so her Q poke has to choose between you and the wave.
- If she tags you with **Q**, be ready to **back up** and avoid taking follow-up hits that set up Q2 missing-HP damage.

**Goal for these levels:** arrive at level 3 with **good HP** and **even CS**.

---

### Levels 3–5: “Track E, take short trades”
Aurora’s anti-assassin pattern is usually:
1) poke with **Q**,  
2) when you step in, she **E** slows + hops back,  
3) if you still chase, she **W** invis/hops away.

Your pattern should be:
- **Short trade** → disengage → repeat, *until* she uses E poorly.
- **Do not** full-send your dash into her while E is available.

**Best window:** Aurora uses **E on the wave** to push.  
That’s when you can step up and threaten:
- **Q poke** + **E dash** pressure  
- or just **zone her off the wave** so she can’t safely harass you.

---

### Level 6+: “Choose between kill and roam”
At level 6, you gain much more map impact, but Aurora also becomes harder to chase because R gives her a zone to play in.

**Decision rule:**  
- If Aurora’s **E or W is down**, look for a **direct kill**.  
- If both **E and W are up**, prioritize **wave crash → roam / vision**.

---

## Trading & all-in rules (very practical)

### 1) The “don’t feed her passive” rule
- If she has already hit you **twice** recently (spells/autos), assume she’s looking for the **3rd hit** to proc passive damage + healing.
- When you’re at 2 stacks, **create distance** and let the rhythm break.

**Your trades should be bursty**, not extended.

---

### 2) The “E is the key” rule
Aurora’s E is her main disengage.

**Do:**
- Bait E by walking up like you want to dash.
- Sidestep so E misses (or hits fewer targets).
- **Then** re-approach during E cooldown.

**Don’t:**
- Dash in first and hope she doesn’t E you. She will.

---

### 3) Use Naafiri W like a spell-shield (timing tool)
Naafiri W gives a brief **Untargetable** window.

High value uses vs Aurora:
- **Dodge Aurora E** slow + damage when you commit.
- **Dodge Aurora R pulse** damage/slow on landing.
- Occasionally to deny her “tag you low then Q2” burst during an all-in.

**Common mistake:** using W for “speed only” and then having nothing to avoid E/R.

---

### 4) The “don’t chase into R” rule
If Aurora R’s defensively:
- she’s trying to make you run through the boundary slow while she edge-jumps.

**Your options:**
- Disengage, take the wave, reset vision.
- Or **reposition** (walk around the zone) and re-enter from a better angle after it ends.
- Or switch targets in skirmishes (her teammates don’t have the zone).

**Worst option:** tunneling on her inside the zone.

---

## Wave management (how you make this matchup consistent)

### Default wave goal: keep the wave “neutral-to-safe”
- Early: let the wave come slightly toward you so you’re not standing in open lane eating Q.
- Mid: when you see Aurora use abilities on wave, look to **thin** and set up a **crash** so you can roam.

### Simple rule set
- If you have **no vision** and Aurora has **E + W**, don’t perma-push. You’re vulnerable to jungle pressure + slows.
- If Aurora uses **E to clear**, look to **fast push** and reset/roam—she can’t punish as easily.

---

## Jungle & river interaction

Aurora’s gank setup is “soft CC” (slows), but it’s enough if you’re extended.

**Respect timings:**
- When she has lane prio, assume she can **W into fog** and appear with the jungler.
- If you’re cursed by Q and slowed by E, you can get run down.

**What you should do:**
- Ward on the side you want to play (don’t hover the unwarded side).
- When you want to roam, do it **after a crash** so you’re not losing 2 waves if it fails.

---

## Midgame & teamfights (how you actually carry)

### Your job is not “kill Aurora first”
Aurora is designed to waste assassin time with mobility + zone control.

**Better priorities:**
- Pick the easiest squishy target *without* multiple escapes.
- Force Aurora to use E/R defensively on someone else, then re-enter.

### How to play around Aurora in fights
- If she’s holding E, don’t start your engage from max range where she sees it coming.
- Flank from fog so her E is **reactive** instead of pre-emptive.
- If she W invis, **stop** and re-acquire; don’t donate your combo into empty space.

---

## Learning objectives (focus games)

### Objective A — “E tracker” (10-game focus)
**Goal:** only hard commit when E is down.  
- In lane, say out loud: “E used — I have a window.”  
- Track whether your engages happen **inside** that window.

**Review question:** did my deaths/all-in fails happen while E was available?

---

### Objective B — “Q hit limit” (5-game focus)
**Goal:** reduce how often Aurora tags you with Q.  
- Track a simple stat: **How many Q hits by 10 minutes?**  
- Aim to cut that number each block of games.

---

### Objective C — “W discipline” (5-game focus)
**Goal:** use Naafiri W to deny her big moments.  
- In every all-in, try to W **reactively** to E/R, not proactively “for speed”.

**Review question:** did I W early and then eat E/R anyway?

---

### Objective D — “Crash → roam or ward” (10-game focus)
**Goal:** every time you crash a wave post-6, do *one* proactive action:
- roam to a side lane, **or**
- place deep vision, **or**
- help your jungler invade/secure an objective.

**Review question:** did I just stand mid after a crash and let Aurora reset for free?

## Quick matchup checklist (in game)

- [ ] Am I staying healthy enough to not die to Q2 missing-HP burst?
- [ ] Did Aurora use **E** on wave? (window to pressure)
- [ ] Is Aurora’s **W** up? (don’t commit blind)
- [ ] If she **R’s defensively**, am I disengaging instead of chasing?
- [ ] Am I using **Naafiri W** to dodge E/R at the moment I commit?

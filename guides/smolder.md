# Naafiri vs Smolder (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first)

### Smolder — what to respect / avoid
- **Passive (Dragon Practice)**: stacks from **hitting champions with abilities** and from **killing units with Q**. His Q evolves at key stack breakpoints — your matchup is **on a timer**.
- **Q (Super Scorcher Breath)**: short-range targeted breath. Later upgrades add **AoE**, extra explosions, and at high stacks it applies a **true-damage burn** and can **execute** low‑health champions while they’re burning.  
  **Avoid:** hanging around at low HP once he’s in his “burn + execute” stage (late game).
- **W (Achooo!)**: long-range sneeze projectile that **Slows** if it hits you; if it hits a **champion**, it also triggers an explosion for extra damage.  
  **This is his main “catch you and kite you” tool early.**  
  **Avoid:** getting tagged by W right before you all-in (you’ll get kited and lose the trade).
- **E (Flap, Flap, Flap)**: short flight that **ignores terrain** and gives big **move speed** while he auto-fires at the lowest‑HP target. This is his main escape.  
  **Key:** Naafiri has *no hard CC* to cancel it — assume he *will* escape if you commit when E is up.
- **R (MMOOOMMMM!)**: long-range call‑down. Deals damage in a wide area; the **center (“sweet spot”) deals more and Slows**. It also **heals Smolder** if it hits him.  
  **Avoid:** getting hit by the **center** during your all-in (you’ll lose the DPS race).

**Smolder CC summary:** only **Slows** (W hit, R sweet spot). No stun/root… but slows are enough to ruin assassin commits.

### Naafiri — your tools in this lane
- **Q (Darkin Daggers)**: lane control + sustain. Your best “safe damage” in this matchup.
- **W (The Call of the Pack)**: **1 second Untargetable** + short buff. This is your “dodge the one spell that matters” button.
- **E (Eviscerate)**: short dash + AoE. Use it to reposition and keep packmates healthy/close (not as a random gap close).
- **R (Hounds’ Pursuit)**: **targeted** champion dash commit + brief slow, with a takedown window for a recast and a shield on second cast.

## Matchup in one sentence
You’re racing Smolder’s scaling: **stay healthy → create tempo (crash/roam/freeze + jungle) → punish before he hits big stack breakpoints**.

---

## Game plan overview (what “winning” looks like)

### Your win conditions
1. **Deny free scaling time**
   - Don’t perma‑handshake mid and let him farm to 125/225 stacks uncontested.
2. **Create repeatable threat**
   - Freeze near your side to force him up, or crash and **leave lane** to impact sides.
3. **Kill windows come from E cooldown**
   - You’re looking for: **Smolder E down** OR **Smolder forced to walk up (frozen wave)** OR **jungler behind him**.

### What Smolder wants
- Slow, safe lane. Spam Q on wave. Land W on you when you walk up.
- Hit stack breakpoints, then outscale fights with upgraded Q and long-range R follow-up.

---

## Setup

### Summoners
- **Flash + Ignite**: best for solo-kill pressure and snowballing the timer.
- **Flash + Teleport**: if your goal is pure tempo (crash → reset → roam) and you’re okay with fewer solo kills.

### Starting items (pick one)
- **Doran’s Shield + potion**: if you expect to get poked a lot / you’re learning the lane.
- **Long Sword + 3 pots** (or refillable): if you want early kill threat and you’re confident dodging W.

### Runes (two practical pages)
**Page A: burst + roam (default)**
- Domination: Electrocute / Sudden Impact / Eyeball / Ultimate Hunter
- Secondary: Sorcery (Nimbus + Transcendence) *or* Resolve (Second Wind + Unflinching)

**Page B: anti-poke stability**
- Resolve: Second Wind + (Bone Plating or Conditioning)
- Secondary: Domination for damage or Sorcery for move speed/haste

*(Exact rune meta shifts patch-to-patch — the important part is: take **some** anti-poke if you’re getting chipped out.)*

## Lane plan (first 6 waves) — concrete script

### Levels 1–2: “HP is your resource”
- **Goal:** don’t get poked to 50% before you can threaten anything.
- Stand **behind minions** so W is harder to land.
- Use **Q for last hits** and occasional poke when he walks up for Q last hits.

**Do NOT:** E forward just to trade. If you dash early, he backs up, you lose HP to autos/Q/W, and the lane becomes unplayable.

### Level 3: “Choose: freeze or crash”
You now have Q + W + E, so you can start playing real lane states.

**Option 1 (most consistent): Freeze near your side**
- Let him push slightly.
- Thin the wave with Q so it doesn’t crash.
- **Ping jungler**: Smolder hates walking up, and his E won’t save him if gank angles cover both sides.

**Option 2: Crash wave 3 and earn tempo**
- If the wave is already pushing away from you, commit to a clean crash.
- On crash, do **one** action:
  1) ward raptors/river entrance, or
  2) roam with jungler, or
  3) reset for item + HP.

### Levels 4–5: “Punish W cooldown, not his HP bar”
- When Smolder uses **W** and misses (or uses it on wave), you get ~10+ seconds where he has much less control over you.
- Use that window for:
  - **Q poke** + wave control
  - stepping up to hold a freeze
  - threatening a short trade (don’t hard-commit unless E is down)

### Level 6: “All-in windows become real”
At 6 you can punish positioning mistakes:
- Smolder walks up to break your freeze
- Smolder uses E aggressively to push/harass
- Smolder’s wave is on your side and he’s not near a wall to hop

## Trading & all-in rules (the matchup is decided here)

### Safe trade pattern (default)
- **Q poke → wait → Q pop** (don’t over-dash)
- Use **E defensively** (dodge W, dodge jungle gank skillshots, reposition after he kites)

### All-in checklist (only commit if you hit at least 2/3)
✅ **Smolder E is down** (best)  
✅ Wave is **closer to your side** (longer lane to chase)  
✅ You have vision of enemy jungler (or your jungler is here)

If you don’t have these, you’re usually flipping the lane.

### How to use W (your “don’t get kited” button)
Treat W like a reaction tool:
- Hold W to **dodge Smolder W** (the slow is what ruins assassin commits).
- Hold W to **dodge Smolder R sweet spot** if he drops it on top of your engage.
- Bonus: W also resets your pack position so your damage doesn’t fall off mid-fight.

**Bad W:** pressing it early “for speed” then eating W slow → you can’t reach him.

### “Best” kill sequence (simple version)
1. Chunk him with Q trades and wave pressure.
2. Wait for **E** (escape) to be used or force him into a long lane.
3. **W (untargetable timing) → R commit → Q/Q pop → E to stay on top of him**.
4. If you get the takedown window, use the **second R** either to:
   - chain to the next target, or
   - reposition out after the kill.

## Wave control — the one habit that makes this matchup easy

### If you’re losing lane
- Stop trying to “win” trades.
- **Freeze** near turret and farm with Q.
- Ping for ganks when the wave is frozen.

### If you’re even
- Crash → ward → reset. Repeat.
- Smolder matching roams early is usually worse for him than just farming; punish him by impacting side lanes.

### If you’re ahead
- Keep the wave on your side and force him to walk up.
- Don’t dive randomly — he can R the wave/area and buy time. Instead, threaten him, then **leave lane** and take plates/objectives elsewhere.

---

## Jungle interaction (how you actually convert)

### Your best gank setup
- **Freeze** 1–2 waves outside your tower.
- Let Smolder step up to Q last hit.
- Ping your jungler to come from the side that blocks his **E over the wall** (or force him to E early).

### When to call ganks
- After Smolder uses **E** (cooldown is long early).
- When he uses **W** and the lane becomes safer to run at him.
- When enemy jungler is showing on the other side of the map.

---

## Mid game plan (don’t let him scale for free)

### What you should do after lane unlocks
- Catch mid wave → push → **disappear**.
- Look for:
  - bot lane collapses
  - jungle invades with your jungler
  - picks on rotations

### Where Smolder is most vulnerable
- Side-lane catching waves alone (especially without E)
- Walking to objectives through fog
- Showing late to fights (you can delete him before he sets up)

### Objective setups (assassin rules)
- Be early. Push mid first.
- Sit in fog with a control ward.
- If Smolder face-checks or arrives late: **kill → objective**.

---

## Teamfights vs Smolder (how not to throw)

### Your identity
- **Flank + cleanup**, not front-to-back DPS.

### Entry rules
- Don’t run straight through his front line — you’ll eat W slow + R sweet spot.
- Approach from the side, wait for key cooldowns, then commit.

### What to dodge
- **W slow** (it’s the “anti-assassin” button)
- **R center** (sweet spot slow + extra damage)

If you only dodge one thing, dodge **W**.

## Common Naafiri mistakes in this matchup (and fixes)

- **Mistake:** You E forward to trade early and get poked out.  
  **Fix:** Q trade only until you have a real all-in window.

- **Mistake:** You R while Smolder E is up and he hops a wall.  
  **Fix:** bait E first, freeze to force him up, or coordinate gank angles.

- **Mistake:** You W for move speed and then get hit by W slow.  
  **Fix:** hold W to *react* to W/R during your commit.

- **Mistake:** You handshake mid for 15 minutes.  
  **Fix:** crash/roam or freeze/gank — don’t give a scaling champ a free game.

---

## Quick checklist (use in-game)
- Is my HP high enough to threaten? If not: farm, freeze, reset.
- Where is Smolder’s **E**? (up/down)
- Where is his **W**? (up/down)
- Can I crash this wave and create a play (ward/roam/reset)?
- If I press R, what’s my **exit** if he survives?

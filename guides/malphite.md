# Naafiri Mid vs Malphite — Matchup Guide (Tempo Assassin Plan)

## Spell snapshot (what to respect / what to dodge)
**Malphite**
- **Passive (Granite Shield):** regenerating shield if he hasn’t been hit recently → trades are much worse while it’s up.
- **Q (Seismic Shard):** **point-and-click poke + slow + MS steal** → you *can’t* dodge it; plan to sustain it.
- **E (Ground Slam):** AoE damage + **attack speed slow** → makes extended trades worse.
- **R (Unstoppable Force):** **unstoppable dash + AoE knockup** → this is the *real* kill button (especially with jungler).

**Naafiri (relevant tools)**
- **W (The Call of the Pack):** **1s untargetable** → your best answer to **Malphite R**. Treat W like a “dodge the ult” button first.
- **R (Hounds’ Pursuit):** targeted commit tool (champion-only) → don’t spend it trying to kill Malphite unless it’s guaranteed.

**Big rule:** you usually **don’t win by killing Malphite**. You win by **staying healthy, controlling the wave, roaming first, and carrying fights after he ults.**

---

## Matchup identity (what you’re actually trying to do)
Malphite mid is a **lane-neutralizer with a level 6 threat spike**. Your job is to:
1) **Not get chunked into “can’t play” HP** by Q spam,  
2) **Keep the wave in a gank-safe spot**,  
3) **Use tempo windows to roam**, and  
4) **Play fights after Malphite’s R is used** (or bait it and dodge with W).

If you play this matchup like “I must solo kill,” you’ll bleed HP/mana and eventually die to **R + jungler**.

---

## Setup (keep it simple and durable)
### Summoners
- **Flash** is mandatory.
- **Ignite** if you want skirmish threat vs their jungler/sidelaners.
- **Teleport** if the game will be slow and you want guaranteed tempo resets (often good into tank Malph).

### Starting item
- **Doran’s Shield** most games (best vs unavoidable Q poke).
- **Long Sword + Refillable** only if you’re confident Malphite isn’t AP-poking you off the wave.

### Runes (principle)
- Take a setup that lets you **stay high HP** and still threaten roams.
- If you frequently get poked out: consider **Resolve secondary (e.g., Second Wind)**.
- If you’re comfortable: standard assassin runes are fine, but your *lane goal* is still stability.

---

## Lane plan in one sentence
**Let the first waves come toward you, farm with Q, don’t E forward, and crash only when you can “crash-and-choose” (ward / roam / reset).**

---

## First 6 waves: a practical lane script
This script assumes “standard” Malphite (tank or Q-max poke). Adapt if you spot full AP items.

### Wave 1 (level 1)
- **Do not hard shove.** Last-hit only.
- If he walks up, throw **Q** when safe mainly to **break passive shield** (even a light tag helps).
- Goal: **arrive level 2 with good HP**.

### Wave 2 (level 2)
- If you’re getting poked: **let the wave push to you**.
- Skill choice:
  - **E at level 2** is fine for safety (gank dodge / spacing).
  - Don’t E forward to “trade” unless Malphite’s passive is down and you’re not getting punished.

### Wave 3 (level 3) — the first decision point
- If the wave is coming to your side: **hold it** (mini-freeze) and farm.
- If you can crash wave 3 safely (rare vs good Malph): crash → **ward or reset**.
- Take **W by level 3** so you have the untargetable ready for sudden all-ins / jungler paths.

### Waves 4–6 (levels 4–5)
- Repeat the loop:
  - **Farm safely**
  - **Thin with Q**
  - **Don’t take extended trades into E**
  - Look for a **clean crash** only when you can immediately convert it into something (ward/roam/reset).

**Trade pattern that doesn’t grief you:**
- **Q1** (tag him when passive is down or to remove it) → back off → **Q2 “pop”** when safe.
- If he Q’s you: don’t panic-trade; **just keep farming** and let your sustain do work.

---

## Wards & jungle safety (the non-negotiable part)
Malphite’s level 6 + jungler is how you die.

### Default ward timings
- **First ward:** around **2:20–2:45** depending on which side you’re on and which jungle path you expect.
- If you’re holding the wave near your tower (recommended), ward the **river entrance** that covers the most direct gank route.
- If you crash and move, place a deeper ward (raptors/river pixel) **only if you can get out safely**.

### The “don’t die to R” rule at level 6
Once Malphite hits 6, stop standing in the lane like nothing changed:
- **Don’t sit at half HP** with no vision.
- **Don’t E forward** unless you know where the enemy jungler is.
- If Malphite starts walking at you with confidence, assume **R is coming**.

---

## Level 6+: how to survive and still win
### What Malphite wants
- **Q poke → you drop to 60–70% → R all-in** (often with jungler follow-up).
- If he’s AP: this is even more direct.
- If he’s tank: he’s mostly looking for **setup** and wave-clear into roaming.

### Your answers
1) **Hold W for R**
   - If Malphite looks like he’s about to pull the trigger (walks up aggressively, angles toward you, disappears into fog), be ready to **W the moment you expect impact**.
   - Even if you don’t “react” every time, playing with W available changes how freely he can ult you.

2) **Wave position is protection**
   - Best wave spot: **on your side of mid** (you can farm, you’re harder to gank, Malph has to overextend to ult).

3) **Roam windows beat kill windows**
   - Crash → roam with jungler, or crash → reset.
   - If Malphite matches, he’s slower pre-6 and predictable post-6 (watch for roam-R angles).

---

## When can you actually kill Malphite?
Not often. Only look for it when **multiple** boxes are checked:
- His **passive shield is down**
- You have a meaningful HP lead (or he’s low mana)
- You have **jungler help** or he has no R / no Flash
- You’re not burning R just to hit a champion that stacks armor

**If he’s tank and stacking armor:** your best “kill” is usually **forcing him to recall** so you can take a plate, roam, or reset with tempo.

---

## Roaming plan (how you win the game)
Your best wins vs Malphite look like:
- Farm stable → **crash** → roam bot/top or link with jungler → take plates/objectives → start picking squishies.

### Roam checklist (quick)
Roam when:
- You **crashed** a wave (or it’s bouncing back to you)
- The roam decision is **<20 seconds** away (fight or return)
- There’s **setup** (ally CC, enemy pushed, no Flash)

Don’t roam when:
- Your wave is slow-pushing away (you’ll lose too much)
- You’re low HP (Malphite can R-punish on return)
- You’re guessing (coinflip)

---

## Mid game & teamfights: play after the rock goes in
### Your fight identity vs Malphite
- **You are not the primary engage.**
- You are **flank + cleanup**.
- Malphite wants to ult first; you want to **punish after** (or bait and dodge).

### The clean pattern
1) Stay off-angle in fog.
2) Let Malphite show his hand (or ult your teammate).
3) **W** to avoid being the easy follow-up target / dodge the key moment.
4) **R** onto a squishy who is now exposed or late to the fight.
5) Convert kill into objective, not a 30-second chase.

### If Malphite is holding R “for you”
- Don’t give him a clean lineup.
- Show briefly, then reposition into fog.
- If he commits on you, your entire job is to **W the R** and let your team punish the whiff.

---

## Itemization notes (don’t overthink it)
- Build to **kill the backline**.
- If Malphite is the only threat and stacking armor hard, consider adding **% armor pen** earlier than usual.
- Otherwise: your gold is better spent reaching your assassin spikes to delete carries.

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)
- **Mistake:** trying to all-in through Granite Shield  
  **Fix:** tag to remove shield, then trade; or ignore and roam.
- **Mistake:** E forward in a “quiet” lane with no vision  
  **Fix:** keep E as a dodge/exit tool unless you’ve tracked jungler.
- **Mistake:** using W for movespeed and then eating R  
  **Fix:** W is your **anti-R** button first.
- **Mistake:** spending R on Malphite because “he’s in range”  
  **Fix:** R is for **squishies, rotations, and fog picks**.

---

## 10-second checklist (use every time you walk to lane)
- Is Malphite level 6+ with Flash? **Assume R threat.**
- Is my wave on my side and do I have vision? **If not, play back.**
- Is my W up? **If yes, I can survive the ult.**
- Can I crash and do something guaranteed (ward/roam/reset)? **If yes, do it.**
- If a fight starts: **Did Malphite ult yet?** If no, don’t be the one he sees first.

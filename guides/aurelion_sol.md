# Naafiri Mid vs Aurelion Sol — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (what you MUST respect)

### Aurelion Sol threats (avoid / play around)
- **R — Falling Star / The Skies Descend (HARD CC):** big AoE impact that **stuns** (Falling Star) or **knocks up** (Skies Descend). Skies Descend also sends a **slow** shockwave.  
  **If you get hit mid-engage, your all-in usually dies.**
- **E — Singularity (zone + pull + execute):** black hole zone that **pulls** you toward the center and **executes** low HP targets.  
  **Never take extended fights inside it. Dash out immediately.**
- **W — Astral Flight (escape + DPS steroid):** he flies away (or forward) and can still cast. While flying, his Q becomes much scarier.  
  **Don’t chase him through open space if he’s flying + breathing on you.**
- **Q — Breath of Light (sustained damage):** channel beam; the longer it stays on you, the worse it gets.  
  **Keep minions between you and him so you’re not the “first hit” target. Break line / leave range.**

### Your key answers as Naafiri
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** **1s untargetable** = your “dodge window” for **Aurelion Sol R** (and many gank CC spells). Treat W like a defensive timing tool first.
- **E — Eviscerate:** short dash to **exit Singularity**, dodge the center of R, or re-stick after you land R.
- **R — Hound’s Pursuit:** targeted commit tool. Use it when **his W is down**, he’s **isolated**, or he’s forced to stand (no peel / no angle).

## Matchup identity: what you’re trying to do

Aurelion Sol wants to **scale safely, shove, and win teamfights** with zones (E) + AoE CC (R).  
Naafiri wants to **stay stable early → create tempo windows → kill/roam once → snowball picks**.

**Your win condition vs A-Sol:**
- **Don’t bleed out to poke.**
- **Take clean tempo windows (crash → ward/roam/reset).**
- **Force fights where A-Sol can’t freely zone (side lanes, fog picks, rotations).**
- **If he gets 2–3 items uncontested, your life becomes much harder.**

---

## Runes, summoners, and starts (practical)

### Summoners
- **Flash + Ignite** (most common): best for kill windows when his W/R are down or he mispositions.
- **Flash + Teleport** (more consistent): if you’d rather win by tempo + resets and not gamble for solo kills.

### Rune pages (pick one)

**Page A — “I want lane stability + real kill threat”**
- **Domination:** Electrocute → Sudden Impact → Eyeball → Ultimate Hunter  
- **Resolve:** Second Wind → (Unflinching / Bone Plating)  
- Works well when you expect to be poked and you want short burst trades.

**Page B — “I want consistent tempo, not coinflips”**
- **Inspiration:** First Strike → (Biscuits) → (Cosmic) → (Approach / whatever you prefer)  
- **Resolve:** Second Wind → (Unflinching)  
- Only pick this if you can reliably avoid getting tagged first (A-Sol can break First Strike easily).

### Starting items
- **Doran’s Shield** if you’re taking repeated poke / struggling to stay high HP.
- **Long Sword + Refillable** if you’re confident you can manage the lane and want earlier damage.

## The lane plan (levels 1–6)

### The #1 rule: never give him a “free beam”
A-Sol Q is a *channel*. If you stand in range as the **first target**, you’ll lose HP for nothing.

**Positioning habit:** stand **behind your wave**, slightly off-center. If he steps up to beam the wave, you farm. If he beams you, you step behind minions / out of range.

---

## First 6 waves lane script (simple + repeatable)

> This is the “consistent” script. You’re not trying to solo-kill him at level 2.

### Wave 1
- Let him push if he wants.
- Last hit safely; use **Q** to last hit and occasionally tag him **only if you don’t become first target of Q**.
- Don’t trade autos for free Q damage.

### Wave 2
- Your goal is **HP preservation** and keeping the wave from crashing too fast.
- If he beams the wave, accept that you won’t have prio — that’s fine.

### Wave 3 (cannon) — gank timing
- Expect junglers to look mid around this window.
- If you are pushed in and can’t leave lane safely, ward **close** (pixel bush or raptor entrance depending on side) when he is busy beaming the wave.
- **Hold E** for escape. Don’t use E aggressively unless you see enemy jungle elsewhere.

### Wave 4–5
- Look for a controlled wave state near your side (a “freeze-ish” or slow push into you).
- If A-Sol uses **E (Singularity)** on the wave to shove:
  - That’s your best “step up” window.
  - Take a **short trade**: Q poke + Q pop if possible, then back off.
  - Do **NOT** all-in unless he is already chunked and you know you can finish fast.

### Wave 6 (second cannon) — your first good reset window
- If you can crash safely, do it and **reset**.
- If you can’t crash, reset on the bounce after collecting the wave near your tower.

**Why this works:** A-Sol scales. Your consistency comes from not losing lane to poke and hitting level 6 with options.

## Kill windows (when you actually get to press R)

### Real kill window checklist (you want 2+ of these)
- ✅ **A-Sol W is down** (he used Astral Flight recently)
- ✅ **A-Sol R is down** (or you’re confident you can W-dodge it)
- ✅ he’s **past river / in a long lane / rotating**
- ✅ you have **Ignite** and he’s already **chunked**
- ✅ your jungler has **reliable CC** (so he can’t just W away)

### The clean “all-in” pattern (most consistent)
1. Get him to ~70% or lower with safe Q pokes / short trades.
2. Wait until he uses **W** (escape) or shows he’s extended.
3. **R** onto him.
4. **Hold W** until you see the **R animation** (many A-Sols panic-R on themselves).  
   Use **W** to go untargetable as the star lands.
5. Use **E** to stay on him or to exit **Singularity** immediately.

### When NOT to all-in
- He has full HP + full cooldowns and you’re engaging from a straight line.
- He can W away into open space and you have no follow-up.
- You’ll have to chase through his **W + Q** for more than ~2 seconds.
- He places **E** under you and you stay inside trying to “finish the kill.”

## Trading patterns that win you lane without gambling

### “Q poke + pop” (safe default)
- Q1 to apply bleed when he steps up to last hit.
- Back up (don’t eat Q beam).
- Q2 pop when safe (even if you only get the pop and not the full chase).

### “E only as a dodge” (most important habit)
Save E to:
- exit Singularity instantly
- dodge the center of Falling Star/Skies Descend
- avoid jungle CC on ganks

If you E forward randomly, you give A-Sol a free R target.

---

## W usage vs Aurelion Sol (your biggest outplay)

**Your W is not “just movespeed.”** It’s the difference between:
- “I got stunned mid-engage and died”
- and “I dodged the star, got the kill, and snowballed”

### What you’re holding W for (priority order)
1. **A-Sol R impact**
2. gank CC (e.g., Vi Q/R, Jarvan EQ, etc.)
3. emergency “drop aggro / stall” moment while your pack respawns

**If you W early for speed and then eat R, you lose the matchup.**

---

## Warding and anti-gank plan (because you’ll often be pushed in)

### Default ward timings
- **2:20–2:45:** first ward (wave 3–4 window).
- **Every reset:** buy a Control Ward; place it on the side you want to play toward.

### Which side do you ward?
- **Play toward your jungler.** Ward the *opposite* side (the side you’re not leaning toward).
- If you’re stuck under tower, choose a **close ward** that actually sees the gank path (pixel bush / raptor entrance) rather than a deep ward you can’t safely place.

## Mid game plan: how you beat a scaling teamfight mage

### 1) Stop living mid
A-Sol loves when you’re visible mid perma-clearing while he stacks Stardust.

Your loop:
1. catch mid wave
2. push it
3. **go dark** (river/jungle) for a pick or hover a side lane
4. if nothing happens, reset or re-show safely

### 2) Fight him in rotations, not in set-up 5v5
A-Sol is strongest when he gets to pre-place E and threaten R on a grouped team.

You are strongest when:
- someone face-checks vision
- someone rotates late
- someone catches a side wave alone

### 3) Objective setups
**Be in fog early (45–60s before dragon/baron).**  
The goal is not “hit the objective” — the goal is “delete the person who tries to ward.”

---

## Teamfights vs Aurelion Sol (how not to suicide)

### Your job
- flank / pick / cleanup
- not front-to-back DPS

### How you enter
- come from the side
- wait for **E or R** to be used
- then commit to a carry (or A-Sol if he’s exposed)

### Targeting
- If A-Sol is the only fed threat and he’s reachable safely → kill him.
- Otherwise, delete the squishy who face-checks, then take objective.

**Never run through Singularity to reach someone.** That’s how you die with no value.

---

## Common mistakes vs A-Sol (and the fix)

### Mistake: you chase him while he’s flying and beaming you
**Fix:** if he presses W to escape, decide fast:  
- can I kill in <2 seconds? (ignite + low HP)  
- if not, **stop chase** → take wave/plates/vision.

### Mistake: you all-in before he uses R, and you eat it
**Fix:** R → **hold W for the star** → then finish.

### Mistake: you stay inside Singularity trying to “win the trade”
**Fix:** E out immediately. Short trades only.

### Mistake: you never roam because he keeps you mid
**Fix:** crash → reset → roam on your next timing.  
Even one good roam can break A-Sol’s scaling.

## Quick checklist every time you consider fighting him
- Is his **W** available?
- Is his **R** available?
- Do I have **W** ready to dodge?
- If he drops **E** under me, do I have **E** to leave?
- If I don’t kill fast, what is my exit?

If you can answer those, you’ll win this matchup way more often.

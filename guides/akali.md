# Naafiri Mid vs Akali — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Don’t let Akali take over side lanes after level 6
- Get to midgame where you can play **fog + picks + objective setups** (your strongest way to carry)

Akali lanes are rarely “won” by forcing constant fights. They’re won by:
- denying her clean **Q+passive** trades,
- not committing into **Shroud**,
- and managing level 6 kill windows.

---

## Why this matchup is hard (in plain terms)
Akali’s kit punishes two things Naafiri players often do by habit:
1) **Extended melee trading** (Akali loves repeated short bursts into a longer chase)
2) **Hard committing into a champion you can’t target** (Shroud resets fights and breaks targeted spells)

Akali’s most common kill pattern is:
- chip you with Q+passive → you get low → level 6 all-in → you die because you couldn’t disengage cleanly.

So your early game is about **HP preservation** + **wave safety**.

---

## Non-negotiable rules (follow these and you stop “failing”)
### Rule 1 — Never “all-in” while Shroud is available
If Akali has W (Shroud) up, assume:
- you will lose target access at the worst time,
- you’ll waste cooldowns,
- and she’ll re-engage when you’re dry.

**Translation:** Don’t press your commit buttons just because you tagged her once.
If she uses Shroud, treat it like a hard reset: **step out, wait it out, re-evaluate.**

### Rule 2 — Don’t donate her Q+passive auto
Akali wants to:
- Q you (poke),
- then use passive to get an empowered auto.

Your counter:
- when she lands Q (or threatens Q), **back up / sidestep** so she can’t get the passive auto for free.
- If you stand still and “take the passive,” you’re letting her win trades every 8–12 seconds forever.

**Simple habit:** After she Q’s, your next movement should be **away from her**, not toward her.

### Rule 3 — Keep the lane short (wave slightly toward you)
A long lane is how Akali turns one small win into a kill.

Default wave plan:
- Let the wave sit **just on your side of mid**, or at least not permanently on her side.
- Shove only when you have a purpose: **crash → ward/roam/reset**.

### Rule 4 — Your W is your “anti-burst / anti-follow” button
In this matchup, wasting W for tempo is a huge reason people die.
Hold W for:
- dodging the *moment* her burst/follow-up would land (often after she commits with E/R),
- or denying her ability to finish when she tries to chain mobility.

### Rule 5 — Respect level 6 like it’s a different game
At level 6, your “safe HP” threshold goes up.
If you’re sitting at ~60–70% HP with no plan, Akali can often threaten lethal with ult rotations.

---

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)
### Levels 1–2: stabilize and don’t lose HP to free Qs
- Prioritize last hits and staying healthy.
- Don’t force melee trades when her Q is available.
- If she walks up: you can Q poke, but don’t chase into her space.

**Goal:** reach level 3+ with good HP and a workable wave.

### Levels 3–5: Shroud appears; your job is discipline
- Keep trades **short**.
- If she Shrouds, do not keep walking forward hoping to “finish” — **disengage**.
- Look for **crash windows** to get vision or reset.

Your best “wins” here are:
- getting a good recall without dying,
- denying her clean trades,
- and not letting the lane become a long chase lane.

### Level 6+: play around her commit windows, not your ego
- If she hits 6 first, back up and let the wave come.
- If she commits (R/E), your goal is to:
  - minimize her follow-up damage,
  - and exit the danger zone without spending everything into Shroud.

---

## Trading rules (what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed)
### Allowed (good, repeatable)
- **Q poke + back off** (especially when she’s last-hitting)
- Trade after she uses Q on the wave and can’t immediately Q you back
- Chip her until she feels pressured to use Shroud defensively, then **reset lane/tempo**

### Forbidden (classic “I lose lane” patterns)
- E forward “for damage” when Shroud is up (you’ll lose target and get punished)
- Taking extended auto fights after she gets passive procs
- R committing when you can’t guarantee follow-up (because Shroud breaks your plan)

---

## The Shroud rulebook (how to actually deal with it)
When Akali presses Shroud, you have 3 good options:

1) **Disengage and wait** (most consistent)  
   - Back up to your minions/tower line.
   - Don’t burn key cooldowns blindly.

2) **Wave action**  
   - If she Shrouds to avoid a trade, you can often use the time to thin/crash the wave.
   - Crashing the wave denies her a clean re-engage lane.

3) **Call help / ping**  
   - Shroud often signals “I want to fight.” Ping danger and be ready for jungle interaction.

What you generally should NOT do:
- “Walk into Shroud to guess where she is.”
That’s how you eat E / ult follow-up and die.

---

## Level 6 interactions (how to stop dying to the first all-in)
### Before level 6
- Keep HP high.
- Keep wave short.
- Avoid giving her repeated Q+passive value.

### During her all-in attempt
Your priorities, in order:
1) **Move unpredictably** (sidestep, don’t run straight lines)
2) **Hold W** for the lethal burst/follow window (don’t panic it early)
3) **Use E** to reposition out of her strongest zone / to create space

**If you survive the first 2–3 seconds of her commit without taking full damage, the all-in often fails.**

---

## Jungle & vision notes (how you get “randomly” killed)
Akali + jungler is nasty because:
- if she tags you and you’re forced to run, you can get pinned in a long lane,
- Shroud can stall and let the jungler arrive.

So:
- If you’re pushing: do it with a plan and vision.
- If the wave is on their side and you don’t see the jungler: **do not trade.**
- Prefer warding the side you’ll lean to, and play that side.

---

## Midgame plan (this is how you actually win the matchup)
Akali wants to:
- leave lane,
- kill side lanes,
- and snowball skirmishes.

Your counter plan:
- don’t match her roam late; either **match early** or **take mid plates/tower**
- hover objectives early and play fog—Akali struggles when she can’t find isolated picks
- avoid isolated 1v1s when she has Shroud + ult available; take fights with teammates/vision

---

## Common death patterns (and fixes)
1) **“I got chipped down and then she killed me at 6”**  
   Fix: stop giving free Q+passive autos; recall earlier; keep wave short.

2) **“I committed, she Shrouded, I lost her, then I died”**  
   Fix: never hard-commit while Shroud is up; disengage on Shroud.

3) **“I pushed mid with no vision and got collapsed”**  
   Fix: shove only with purpose (crash → ward/reset/roam). No vision = no fights.

4) **“I tried to fight inside her wave/shroud zone”**  
   Fix: short trades only; never brawl where she has full control.

---

## Quick mental script (use this every game)
> “Deny Q+passive. Don’t commit into Shroud. Wave slightly toward me. W for burst window. Respect 6.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track only these three stats:
1) **Shroud discipline:** Did I ever commit hard (E forward / big all-in) while Shroud was available? (Y/N)  
2) **Passive denial:** After Akali Q, did I back up to deny the empowered auto most of the time? (Y/N)  
3) **Level 6 deaths:** If I died after level 6, was my HP already low or was the wave long? (Low HP / Long lane / Both / Neither)

Goal: by game 10, you should feel like “Akali can’t just farm me for free anymore,” even if the lane is still tense.

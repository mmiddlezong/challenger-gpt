# Naafiri Mid vs Lux — Matchup Guide (Macro + Consistency)

## Spell quick-sheet (start here)

### Lux (what you must respect)
- **Passive — Illumination:** Lux’s spells mark you; her next **auto attack** consumes the mark for bonus damage. *Most of her “poke” is actually spell → auto.*
- **Q — Light Binding (HARD CC):** Long, thin skillshot that **roots** (stops movement) and can hit **two** units.  
  **If you get rooted, you can eat E + auto + R + jungle gank. This is the #1 spell to avoid.**
- **W — Prismatic Barrier:** Boomerang shield (out + back). Not CC, but it can **erase your trade** if she times it well.
- **E — Lucent Singularity (soft CC + zone):** Creates a zone that **slows** and can be detonated for damage. Also gives **vision** in the area.  
  *It’s her main poke + wave control tool; don’t stand in it for free.*
- **R — Final Spark:** Long-range laser burst. Used to **finish kills**, punish recalls, or waveclear.  
  *If you’re low HP and visible, you’re always in danger.*

### Naafiri (your key tools into Lux)
- **Q — Darkin Daggers:** Primary lane tool (poke + last-hit). Lets you trade without full committing and helps you stay healthy.
- **W — The Call of the Pack (OUTPLAY WINDOW):** Gives you a **brief untargetable window** plus a short steroid and extra packmates.  
  **Use it to dodge the spell that matters (usually Lux Q), not just for speed.**
- **E — Eviscerate:** Dash + burst. Use it to **sidestep** and to **finish** after Lux misses Q.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** Targeted commit to a champion. Great for punishing Lux **after** her Q is down or when she’s isolated.

## Matchup identity (what this lane really is)

Lux wants a boring lane:
- poke you to 50–60% HP,
- hold Q to stop your engage,
- out-waveclear you and scale into laser + pick threat.

You want a disciplined lane:
- stay high HP, don’t get chunked,
- control wave so you get clean crashes,
- punish **missed Q** with short trades or an all-in,
- convert any kill/recall into plates and tempo.

**The lane is decided less by mechanics and more by:**
1) how often you get hit by Q, and  
2) whether you take bad damage trying to “force” fights.

## Your win conditions vs Lux

### Primary win condition: “Lux misses Q → you get to play the game”
When Lux Q is down (or used on wave), you can:
- walk up and **force a trade**,
- call your jungler for a **high-percentage gank**,
- threaten an all-in at level 6.

### Secondary win condition: “Tempo assassin”
If Lux plays safely:
- crash wave,
- ward one side,
- roam with your jungler / threaten bot,
- return mid before you lose a full wave.

Lux is immobile and hates losing mid tower. If you win tempo, she gets stuck catching waves while you influence the map.

---

## The golden rules (repeat these every game)

1) **Never fight Lux when you don’t have a minion buffer.**  
   Lux Q is much harder to land if you’re behind minions. If you’re in open space, you’re gambling.

2) **Treat Lux Q as “the lane.”**  
   Everything you do should be about:  
   - baiting it,  
   - dodging it with movement/E/W,  
   - then punishing her during the cooldown.

3) **If you are below ~60% HP, you are in “laser + gank” range.**  
   Don’t linger low. Crash and reset.

4) **W is not a speed button. It is a “don’t get rooted” button.**  
   If you W early and reappear into Q, you lose the entire point of W.

## Laning plan by levels

### Levels 1–2: “HP is your resource”
**Goal:** reach level 3 without being poked to half.

- Last hit safely; don’t walk into E zone for a single minion unless you must.
- Use your Q to last-hit from safer angles and to lightly tag Lux when she oversteps.
- Respect her passive: if she tags you with E, she wants the auto. Back up to deny it.

**What to avoid:**
- stepping up when Lux has both Q and E available,
- eating E + auto repeatedly just to keep perfect CS.

### Levels 3–5: “Crash → choose”
**Goal:** get one clean crash and earn a choice (ward / roam / reset).

- If Lux uses E to hit the wave, her poke threat drops briefly.
- Your best trades happen when Lux Q is down, or when you’re behind minions and she can’t easily line it up.

**Trade pattern (safe):**
1) stand behind your caster minions,
2) step forward just enough to threaten,
3) if Lux throws Q and misses, immediately walk up for Q poke + pack pressure,
4) back off before she re-stabilizes with E slow.

**If Lux holds Q forever:**
That’s fine. You can still win by wave control + tempo. Don’t get impatient.

### Level 6+: “Punish positioning, don’t coinflip”
Lux’s big threat increases (R follow-up), but your kill pressure also becomes real.

**Your best all-in window is:**
- Lux Q is used/missed, **or**
- Lux is far from tower with no vision/jungle help, **or**
- Lux is already chunked and you can guarantee the finish.

**Bad all-ins are:**
- R’ing from max range while Lux still has Q + Flash,
- diving while you’re low enough to be executed by R.

## Wave management vs Lux (the consistency section)

### Your default wave goal: keep it slightly on your side early
Why:
- it reduces Lux’s angles to hit Q,
- it makes ganks on you less lethal,
- it gives your jungler better gank setups if Lux steps up.

**Practical rule:**  
If you’re unsure, **do not auto the wave**. Last-hit only and let it drift toward you.

### When to push
Push when you have one of these:
- Lux used E on wave and you can accelerate a crash,
- Lux recalled,
- you want a roam timer,
- you want to reset safely.

### Cannon-wave crash habit
A very reliable pattern:
- build a small slow push,
- crash on a cannon wave,
- immediately choose: ward/roam/reset.

This is one of the cleanest ways to avoid “random Lux poke deaths.”

## Trading & all-in rules (how to actually win the lane)

### What you are trying to accomplish with trades
You are not trying to “win every trade.”
You are trying to:
- keep Lux’s HP low enough that she cannot freely spam E on wave,
- force her to spend mana defensively,
- threaten an all-in so she plays scared.

### The main spacing concept
Lux wants you in “no-minion space” so Q is easy.
You want to fight **through** minions and around corners of the wave.

### How to use W into Lux (the important part)
**Hold W for Lux Q unless you are 100% sure she can’t punish.**

Two good uses:
- **Reactive dodge:** Lux throws Q → you W at the last moment to avoid the root.
- **Commit timing:** Lux Q missed / is on cooldown → you W (buff + pack) *then* you look for the kill.

Two bad uses:
- W just to run at her while Q is up (you’ll reappear into root),
- W on wave for no reason when jungle could gank.

### How to use E into Lux
Use E to:
- change your hitbox and dodge Q/E,
- close the gap **after** her Q is unavailable,
- finish when she’s in lethal range.

Avoid using E forward when Lux still has Q and you don’t have W ready.

## Jungle interaction (how this matchup swings)

Lux mid is extremely gankable *if Q is down*.
But Lux also makes ganks deadly *if you get rooted*.

### If your jungler is pathing to you
- communicate (pings) when Lux Q is down or when she just used E.
- try to hold wave closer to your side so Lux must step up.

### If the enemy jungler is near
Lux Q + jungler CC/slow is often a guaranteed flash or death.
So:
- keep one side warded,
- don’t push without information,
- don’t walk into river alone when Lux is missing.

---

## Roaming vs Lux (how to win without solo killing)

Lux can clear waves and hold mid. You roam to:
- get side lanes ahead,
- secure dragons with numbers,
- make Lux choose between following (dangerous for her) or losing map control.

**Roam checklist (must meet 2/3):**
- wave is crashed or bouncing back to you,
- you know where enemy jungler likely is,
- there is real setup (ally CC / enemy pushed / no flashes).

If you can’t meet that, just reset and keep tempo.

---

## Mid game & teamfights vs Lux

### Your priority: Lux is a backliner with one “stop button”
In fights:
- Lux Q is the spell that stops you.
- Lux E slows and zones entrances.
- Lux R deletes low HP targets who show.

**Carry pattern:**
- approach from flank/fog,
- wait for Lux to throw Q at someone else (or dodge it),
- then commit to Lux/ADC (whoever is easier to delete).

### Don’t do this
- R straight through the front line while Lux is staring at you.
- Start fights from mid lane in full vision.

## Common mistakes in this matchup (and fixes)

1) **Getting hit by Q while trying to last hit.**  
   Fix: last-hit from behind minions; give up 1–2 CS instead of losing 40% HP.

2) **Using W too early.**  
   Fix: hold W until Lux Q is in the air / about to land or until Q is confirmed down.

3) **Taking repeated E + passive autos.**  
   Fix: if Lux hits you with E, immediately step back to deny the passive auto.

4) **Roaming on a bad wave.**  
   Fix: roam only after a crash/bounce; otherwise you lose lane + roam.

5) **Staying low HP “because I’m almost level 6.”**  
   Fix: crash and reset. Lux can laser you and break your whole game.

## Focused learning objectives (use these for 10 games)

### Objective A: “No free Qs”
**Rule:** If Lux Q hits you in lane, write down *why* (no minion buffer? greedy CS? W/E down?).  
**Goal:** 0–1 Q hits in lane phase (first 10 minutes).

### Objective B: “Punish missed Q once per cooldown”
Every time Lux misses Q, you must do **one** of:
- take a short trade (Q poke),
- force Lux off the wave,
- gain wave control to crash.

If you do nothing after a missed Q, you’re letting her reset for free.

### Objective C: “Cannon crash into a choice”
On cannon waves:
- crash,
- then immediately ward/roam/reset (no indecision mid).

### Objective D: “HP threshold discipline”
If you drop below a comfortable HP threshold (pick one: 65% or 60%):
- your next objective is **crash → reset**.
Stop playing “one more wave” while laser + gank threatens you.

## Quick cheat sheet (print this mentally)

- **Respect:** Lux Q (root) first, Lux E zone second, Lux R finisher always.
- **Lane goal:** stay healthy, keep minion buffer, earn crashes.
- **Trade rule:** punish missed Q; don’t engage through Q.
- **W rule:** hold for Q dodge or commit timing.
- **Win reliably:** crash → roam/ward/reset → repeat; don’t coinflip all-ins.

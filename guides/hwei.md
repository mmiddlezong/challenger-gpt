# Naafiri vs Hwei (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Hwei spells (ultra concise) — what can CC you / stop your engage

**The big rule:** Hwei has **one “CC book” (E / Torment)**. If he *uses any Torment spell*, he has **no other Torment spell** until that cooldown comes back. Your best all-ins happen during that window.

### Passive: Signature of the Visionary
- Hitting you with **two different damaging spells** sets up a delayed **explosion** under/near you.
- Translation: don’t eat “two free hits” when you don’t have to. Respect his two-spell trade pattern.

### Q book (damage / wave control)
- **QQ (Devastating Fire):** fast fireball that explodes on first hit; strong poke + waveclear.
- **QE (Molten Fissure):** long-range line that erupts into lava; **zone + slow + DoT**. Don’t chase through the lava.
- **QW (Severing Bolt):** very long-range delayed strike; **hits harder if you’re isolated or immobilized**. This is what finishes you after you get CC’d.

### W book (defense / tempo)
- **WQ (Fleeting Current):** movement speed “river” path (helps him kite / reposition).
- **WW (Pool of Reflection):** shield zone (denies your burst).
- **WE (Stirring Lights):** 3-hit empower + mana return (more damage + lane sustain).
  - If he uses **WE**, he **does NOT have WQ/WW** until W cooldown returns.

### E book (Torment) — *this is what you must play around*
- **EQ (Grim Visage):** line skillshot that **knocks down + fears** (hard CC). This can interrupt dashes and completely ruin your commit.
- **EW (Gaze of the Abyss):** “eye” placed on the ground; after a short delay it locks onto the nearest champion and launches; **roots** the first unit hit and **reveals** you.
- **EE (Crushing Maw):** delayed AoE jaw; **pulls** you to center and **slows** (displacement + setup).

### R (Spiraling Despair)
- Projectile attaches to a champion; expanding zone deals damage and applies **stacking slow**, then explodes.
- If you get tagged and you’re not confident you win the all-in, you often need to **break off** and reset instead of forcing.

## Threat summary (the 3 patterns that kill Naafiri)
1. **You commit while Torment (E) is up** → you get **EQ feared** or **EW rooted** → he layers **QW + R** → you die or lose flash.
2. You get chipped by **QQ/QE** and become “all-inable” by his jungler (you’re low HP and can’t contest wave).
3. You roam/rotate through fog and face-check **EW** → rooted → collapsed on.

---

## Your win condition as Naafiri
**You don’t have to “solo kill Hwei on cooldown.”** You win by:
- staying healthy and farming until you get a **clean crash timer**
- tracking **Torment (E)** and punishing when it’s used (especially if it misses or is used on wave)
- converting pressure into **plates**, **river control**, and **roams**
- in mid game, killing Hwei (or their carries) from **fog/flanks** after he’s spent CC

---

## Lane plan (what to do, by phase)

### Levels 1–2: “HP is your resource”
**Goal:** arrive to level 3 with enough HP to threaten.  
- Last-hit safely; don’t walk up to eat QQ + passive setup for free.
- Use the minion wave as a shield vs EQ/QQ lines.
- If he’s shoving with QE early, don’t panic—just keep HP high and let the wave come.

**Common trap:** trading autos into his range while he still has full spells. You lose those trades.

---

### Levels 3–5: “Track Torment, then trade on the window”
This is where you start making the matchup playable.

#### What you’re watching for
- **Did he use E (Torment)?**  
  If yes: he has **no fear/root/pull** until that cooldown returns → this is your best trade/all-in window.
- **Did he use W (Serenity)?**  
  If he used **WE**, he can’t shield/speed immediately → his defense is lower.
- **Did he use Q on the wave?**  
  If he used **QE** to clear, his immediate damage pattern is reduced for a moment.

#### Your default trading rule
- **Never hard-commit while Torment is available.**
- Look for **short trades** when:
  - Torment was just used
  - or he used WE + another spell and is “defenseless”

**Short trade idea (safe):**
- Tag with Q poke + step back
- If he whiffs E trying to catch you, you can re-approach for a bigger trade

---

### Level 6+: “All-in only after you disarm his CC”
At 6, Naafiri becomes lethal—*if you choose correct windows*.

#### “Green light” all-in checklist (you want at least 2)
- Torment (E) was just used **or** you saw it miss
- He used **WE** (so he can’t shield/speed) **or** you can burst through a shield
- Wave is not so big that you die to minions while chasing
- You know where the enemy jungler is (or you’re not overextending)

#### “Red light” (don’t press R)
- Torment is up and you’re about to dash in a straight line
- You don’t have an exit plan (you’re committing into a gank angle)
- You’re already below ~70% HP from poke

---

## Wave management: how to stop Hwei from “bullying you out”

### Default plan (most consistent)
- **Let the wave come slightly toward you early.**
- Thin the wave; don’t let it stack huge (huge wave = you can’t trade).
- Crash when you have a reason: **ward / reset / roam**.

### When you’re winning lane
- Push, crash, then disappear (fog + roam threat).
- Hwei hates walking into river without vision.

### When you’re losing lane
- Don’t fight for prio.
- Farm under tower with Q and look for **crash → safe recall** instead of forced trades.

---

## Trading & spacing rules (specific to Hwei)

### Rule 1: treat Torment (E) like a “do not enter” sign
- If he’s holding E, he’s holding **your engage denial**.
- Force him to spend it on:
  - wave control
  - your jungler
  - or a missed skillshot

### Rule 2: don’t chase through QE lava
- QE is designed to punish “straight-line chases.”
- If you must chase, take a wider angle or disengage and re-enter from fog.

### Rule 3: respect QW when you’re isolated or CC’d
- If you get rooted/feared/pulled, expect QW to land right after.
- If you see the setup, sometimes the correct play is **W/E defensively and leave**.

### Rule 4: punish WE usage (lights circling him)
When WE is active, it’s giving him damage + mana sustain, but it also means:
- he **won’t have WW shield** or **WQ speed** for a while
- if he also used Torment recently, he’s very vulnerable

---

## Jungle interaction (how to turn this matchup in your favor)

### Your best gank setup
- Hold the wave near your side.
- Let Hwei push.
- Once he’s extended, ping your jungler and be ready to **follow** (you don’t need to start with R).

### What you must avoid
- Slow-pushing a massive wave, then standing on his side of mid with no vision.
- You will get rooted/feared and die.

### Vision rule (simple)
- If you crash a wave and don’t roam, **drop a ward**.
- Hwei’s kit is great at punishing you when you’re ganked while low HP.

---

## Roaming vs staying mid

### When roaming is high value
- You crashed a wave and Hwei is stuck clearing under tower.
- Bot lane is gankable (pushed, no flashes, ally CC available).
- Enemy jungler showed top and you can move first.

### When roaming is low value
- Hwei is matching the wave and can instantly clear and follow.
- Your wave is pushing away from you (you’ll lose multiple waves + plate).
- You don’t have clear setup—coinflip roams are how you fall behind.

**Consistency tip:** Roam less, but make each roam higher quality.

---

## Mid/Late game plan vs Hwei
Hwei is strongest when teams are grouped and he can layer zones + CC. You’re strongest when fights start from **fog**.

### Your priorities
1. **Side lane pressure** (forces Hwei to show somewhere)
2. **Control wards + fog angles** around objectives
3. **Pick Hwei or their carry** when they rotate

### Teamfighting rule
- Don’t be the first to show.
- Wait until Hwei uses Torment (or shows a Torment cast on someone else), then commit from a flank.

---

## Common Naafiri mistakes in this matchup
- **R’ing straight at him while Torment is up.** (He’s waiting for it.)
- **Using your defensive tools to “go faster”** then getting EQ/EW’d and dying.
- **Eating poke to last-hit one minion.** HP is what allows your level 6 threat.
- **Chasing through QE zone** and turning a winning fight into a losing one.

## Learning objectives (focus your next games)

### Objective A: Torment tracking (5 games)
**Goal:** take 0 “bad” engages.  
- Every time you think “I can kill,” ask: *“Did he use E recently?”*
- Review after game: count how many times you engaged while Torment was up.

### Objective B: HP discipline (5 games)
**Goal:** arrive to level 6 with enough HP to threaten.  
- No trades below your minion wave when you don’t have cooldown advantage.
- Review: how many pots did you have left at 6? Did you lose HP to avoidable QQ/QE?

### Objective C: Crash → action (5 games)
**Goal:** every crash produces value.  
- After crashing, choose one: **ward / reset / roam / plate**
- Review: did you ever crash and then just “stand mid” doing nothing?

### Objective D: All-in quality (5 games)
**Goal:** your R is never a coinflip.  
- Only R when at least **2 green lights** are true (Torment down, W down, jungler tracked, good wave).
- Review: every death after using R—what was the preventable reason?

---

## Quick in-game reminders (sticky-note version)
- **If Torment is up, I don’t commit.**
- **If WE is active and Torment was used, I look for the punish.**
- **Don’t chase through QE lava.**
- **Crash the wave before I roam.**

# Naafiri Mid vs Twisted Fate — matchup guide (tempo assassin plan)

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first — what CC to respect)

### Twisted Fate (your problems)
- **Q — Wild Cards:** long-range poke + waveclear. *Dodge by sidestepping; minions do NOT block it.*
- **W — Pick a Card (the matchup):**
  - **Gold Card = point-and-click stun (1–2s)** on his next auto. **This is what gets you ganked and stops your all-in.**
  - **Red Card = AoE slow** on his next auto. If you stand near the minion he Red Cards, you get slowed and then eat Q.
  - **Blue Card = mana restore + damage** (less threatening for kills).
- **E — Stacked Deck:** every 4th auto hits harder (he’ll “stack it on the wave” then look to trade with a card).
- **R — Destiny/Gate:** **reveals all champions** and lets him **teleport** to start fights elsewhere. This is why you must manage wave/tempo.

### Naafiri (your answers)
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** **1s untargetable** → your **anti-Gold-Card button**. Use it to deny the stun window and to dodge gank follow-up.
- **E — Eviscerate:** short dash for spacing (don’t waste it forward if you don’t have a plan to avoid Gold Card).
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** long-range **champion-only commit**. Great to punish TF when his stun is down, but **don’t press it if Gold Card is ready and you can’t dodge it**.

## 20-second matchup identity

**You win by keeping TF “stuck mid” and punish-roaming him.**  
Your best games look like:

**stable lane HP → crash a wave → ward/roam/reset → hit 6 → threaten kill when Gold Card is down → take plates/mid tower → shadow sidelanes while tracking his R cooldown.**

If you let TF freely shove-and-ult, you’re playing his game.

---

## The 5 rules that decide this lane

1. **Never E/R forward into a TF who is holding Gold Card** unless you are *actively dodging it* with W timing.
2. **Stop standing next to low HP caster minions.** TF’s Red Card splash slow → guaranteed Q is how you lose trades without him “outplaying.”
3. **Play the lane on the warded side.** TF + jungler + Gold Card is one of the easiest mid gank setups in the game.
4. **Crash waves with a plan.** Every crash must become: *ward* / *reset* / *roam* / *plate*. No idle mid.
5. **TF level 6 is a timer.** Your priority becomes: **wave control + punish his ult** (plates, vision, invade with jungler).

## Runes & summoners (simple, matchup-focused)

### Keystone
- **Electrocute**: best for **reliable kill pressure** when TF misuses Gold Card.
- **First Strike**: only if you consistently avoid getting poked first (hard vs TF Q), otherwise it gets turned off.

### Secondaries (pick one)
- **Resolve (Second Wind + Unflinching/Bone Plating):** best if you’re taking poke or worried about gank → makes lane stable.
- **Precision (Triumph + Coup/Last Stand):** best if you’re confident you’ll all-in and snowball.

### Summoners
- **Ignite** if you want solo kill threat and snowball.
- **Teleport** if you want maximum consistency vs TF roams (you’ll still punish his R with plates, but TP helps you not bleed waves).

---

## Lane script: first 6 waves (very concrete)

### Wave 1 (levels 1–2): “HP is your resource”
**Goal:** don’t get chunked to 50% by Q + autos.

- Start **Q**. Last-hit with Q when needed; don’t walk up for every auto.
- Stand **slightly off-center** so TF has to choose between hitting you or the wave with Q.
- If TF walks up with **W active**, back up. Don’t “test” the range.

**If you’re vs heavy poke start:** consider Doran’s Shield style play (farm, stay high HP, scale into 6).

### Wave 2: “don’t get Red Carded for free”
- TF will often **Red Card the wave** to push. Watch which minion he wants to auto.
- **Spacing rule:** if a caster minion is about to die, don’t stand next to it. Make him choose: push OR hit you.

### Wave 3 (level 3): “you now have tools; don’t spend them badly”
You have Q/W/E options. Your default is:
- **Hold E** for dodge/spacing (not for an opener).
- **Hold W** for *Gold Card* or a jungler ability.

If TF locks Gold Card:
- Step back, let it time out or force him to spend it on a minion.
- Only trade after the card is gone.

### First ward window (usually after a crash or when wave is neutral)
**When you’re pushing:** ward **enemy raptor entrance** (or river pixel on the side you’re playing).  
**When you’re getting pushed:** ward **your river pixel** and hover that side.

> Your lane is not “dangerous” because TF solos you — it’s dangerous because **Gold Card makes jungler ganks trivial**.

### Waves 4–5: “crash-and-choose”
Your goal is your first clean crash and a choice:
- **Reset** (most consistent): buy + return with tempo.
- **Ward deeper** (raptors / river): to play the lane more aggressively.
- **Roam with jungler** if it’s a *guaranteed* play.

Don’t roam on a slow push away from you. TF will happily take two waves + plate and then ult anyway.

### Wave 6-ish / Level 6: “ult timing starts”
The moment TF hits 6:
- **Ping it** (danger bot/top).
- Play the next 1–2 waves with intent: **either keep him under tower** or be ready to **punish his leave**.

---

## Trading patterns (how to win without coinflipping)

### Safe poke trade (your default)
- **Q1 → back off → Q2 pop** when he’s bleeding.
- You win lane by **not losing HP** and forcing him to burn mana on wave.

### “Bait Gold Card” pattern (key skill)
You want him to *spend* Gold Card without stunning you.
1. Step up like you might last-hit.
2. The moment he starts the **Gold Card auto**, press **W** to become untargetable.
3. As soon as the card whiffs, you can **walk up and Q trade** (or all-in if it’s lethal).

**Important:** don’t W too early. If you W and he just holds the card, you wasted your only safety window.

### The #1 thing to avoid
- **E forward → get Gold Carded → jungler arrives → you die.**
If you E forward, it must be because:
- Gold Card is down, **or**
- you’re about to W-dodge it, **or**
- you have Flash and a guaranteed kill.

## Kill windows (when Naafiri actually kills TF)

TF is immobile and squishy — you *can* kill him — but only in the right windows.

### Window A: he uses Gold Card on the wave
If TF spends Gold Card to last-hit a cannon / clear:
- **That’s your best lane window.** He has no stun for the next seconds.
- Look for **R commit** if:
  - you have enough HP to tank a Q,
  - you’re not getting counterganked,
  - the wave state won’t punish you (preferably after a crash / on a neutral wave).

### Window B: he Red Cards to shove + misses Q
If he uses Red Card splash to push and Q misses:
- He just spent his “push and punish” pattern.
- You can take a **short trade** or threaten an all-in on the next cycle.

### Window C: he tries to ult in your face
If TF activates ult and starts to set up Gate while you’re in lane range:
- You often can **force him to cancel** by threatening lethal (R + burst).
- Even if you don’t kill, making him cancel Gate is a huge win (his whole champion is roams).

## All-in scripts (simple, repeatable)

### “Standard punish” all-in (Gold Card down)
1. **W** (buff + pack recall) *or* save W if you expect a panic Gold Card.
2. **R** onto TF.
3. **Q → E** to stay on top of him (use E to dodge Q angle or follow Flash).
4. **Q pop** to finish.

### “Outplay” all-in (Gold Card up, but you can dodge)
1. Walk up → bait Gold Card auto.
2. **W to dodge the Gold Card**.
3. Instantly **R** (he has no stun now).
4. **Q + E + Q pop**.

### If you have Ignite
Ignite early in the all-in so you don’t lose kill to Flash + potion ticks.

## Wave management vs TF ult (how to stop him playing the map)

### Your best anti-TF ult positions
- **Freeze/hold near your side** when you’re worried about ganks.
- **Crash when you want to reset** or when you want to deny his roam timer.

### The goal isn’t “perma shove”
Perma-shoving without wards just means you die to Gold Card gank. Instead:
- Push **only when you can ward** or when jungler is nearby.
- Otherwise keep the wave **neutral or slightly toward you** and punish his step-ups.

### When TF ults
You usually choose **one**:
- **Hard shove + take plates** (default best)
- **Follow on foot** only if you can arrive *before* the fight resolves (rare)
- **Invade with your jungler** on the side he left (take camps + vision)

If you hesitate, you get none of the above.

---

## Warding plan (anti-gank + anti-roam)

### If you’re pushing
- Ward **enemy raptors entrance** (best info vs mid ganks).
- Control ward **one river pixel** and play on that side.

### If you’re being pushed
- Ward **your river pixel** (or the side bush entrance to lane).
- Don’t stand in the middle of the lane when TF has Gold Card ready.

### Roam tracking
Once TF is 6+, treat missing TF as: “could be ulting.”
- Ping danger immediately.
- Look at sidelanes: if they’re overextended, TF is almost certainly looking.

## Mid game & teamfights (how you don’t become the “suicide assassin”)

### Your job
- You are **pick + punish rotations**, not a front-to-back DPS.
- TF’s job is **catch with Gold Card** and start numbers plays.

### How you enter fights vs TF
1. Approach from fog/flank.
2. Identify: **who can CC you?** (TF Gold Card + support CC usually).
3. **Hold W** until you see the Gold Card thrown or forced.
4. After Gold Card is gone: **R onto TF or the carry** (whoever is exposed).

### Midgame warning: Rapid Firecannon Gold Card
If TF buys **RFC**, his Gold Card threat range becomes much longer.
- Play as if he has an extra “screen” of stun range.
- Your W timing becomes even more valuable — don’t waste it for movespeed.

---

## Itemization notes (matchup-specific, not a full build guide)

- **Mercury’s Treads** are very strong into TF because they reduce the stun duration and add MR.
- A **spell-shield item** (commonly *Edge of Night*) can force TF to “break” your shield before he can Gold Card you.
- If TF is AP and you’re getting chunked, an early **MR component** (into an MR lifeline item later) can stabilize lane.

---

## Common mistakes in this matchup (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** dashing forward while he’s holding Gold Card  
  **Fix:** bait it first, or W-dodge it on reaction.

- **Mistake:** standing next to a minion he can Red Card  
  **Fix:** treat Red Card like a mini-Anivia Q: don’t stand in splash.

- **Mistake:** matching TF roams late  
  **Fix:** if you can’t arrive in time, **take plates** and get deep vision instead.

- **Mistake:** using W for movespeed at the start of a fight  
  **Fix:** vs TF, W is primarily your **anti-stun window**.

## Quick in-game checklist (use every wave)

After every wave crash, ask:
1. Where is enemy jungler likely?
2. Is TF’s **Gold Card** available (and is he holding it)?
3. Is TF level 6 (or close), and is his **R** up?
4. What is my best guaranteed action: **ward / reset / roam / plate**?

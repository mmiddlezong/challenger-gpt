# Naafiri Mid vs Irelia — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Wave **on your side** as often as possible
- Make it to midgame where you can pick off squishies and play fog/obj setups

This matchup is mostly about **wave position** + **not giving Irelia a minion ladder**.

---

## Why this matchup is hard
Irelia’s threat spikes when:
- She has **4 passive stacks** (huge DPS).
- There are **multiple low minions** she can Q-reset through to reach you.
- The lane is **long** (wave on her side / mid), letting her chase.

So your entire laning phase is: **deny stacks + deny reset paths + shorten the lane**.

---

## Non‑negotiable rules
### Rule 1 — Never trade into 4 stacks
If she’s stacked or about to stack: **back up**. Give a CS if needed.  
Most deaths start with “I hit her while she was stacked.”

**Checklist:** Before any trade, quickly check her stacks.

### Rule 2 — Keep the wave on your side
Default plan is a small freeze / slow push into you.

**How to do it (simple actions):**
- Waves 1–2: **last-hit only** (don’t spam autos).
- If you start pushing accidentally: **stop hitting** and let her push back.
- If she hard shoves: thin safely with **Q from range**, don’t walk into her stacked wave.

### Rule 3 — Don’t stand near multiple low minions
If 2–4 of your minions are low at the same time, she can Q chain into you.

**What to do:**
- When you notice several minions are about to die: **step back for 2 seconds**.
- Let her last-hit without giving her a dash path onto you.

### Rule 4 — Your W is an “anti-death” button
Do **not** W aggressively just for tempo in this matchup.
Save W to:
- deny/dodge the moment her **E stun** would land
- avoid the “one hit → run down” chain after she engages

---

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)
### Levels 1–2
- Play calm. Prioritize HP.
- Don’t auto the wave too much; avoid creating a big push.
- If she walks up for free stacks on minions, **do not contest** unless you’re sure she’s low stacks.

### Levels 3–5
- Your “good” trades are short: **Q poke → back off**.
- Use E mostly **defensively** (dodge / disengage), not as an opener.
- Focus on **wave control**: keep it near your tower and punish only when she mispositions.

### Level 6+
- Don’t look for ego solo kills.
- Look for: crash wave → **roam/reset** windows.
- If she ever wastes resources and ends up low, you can punish, but never through her stacked wave.

---

## Trading: what’s allowed vs forbidden
### Allowed (low risk)
- Q poke when she is **low stacks** and not on a reset path
- Short trades when she Q’s to a minion and ends without more Q targets

### Forbidden (how you die)
- Extended fighting (auto wars) with her stacked
- E forward for damage without a clear exit
- Fighting inside her stacked wave

---

## Jungle interaction (how to actually win games)
- Wave on your side = Irelia is gankable.
- If she perma pushes: ping your jungler and **hold the wave**; don’t start fights.
- If you must roam, do it only after a crash, and return before she gets a free long-lane all-in.

## Common death patterns (and fixes)
1) **“She flew at me through minions”**  
   Fix: stop standing near multiple low minions; step back during last-hit moments.
2) **“I tried to trade and got run down”**  
   Fix: never trade into stacks; keep trades short.
3) **“I got stunned and died instantly”**  
   Fix: save W to deny/dodge E stun; play wave near your tower.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Wave near me. Don’t trade into stacks. Don’t stand near low minions. W for stun moment.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track only these three stats:
1) Did I trade into 4 stacks? (Y/N)  
2) Where was the wave when I got chunked/died? (My side / Mid / Her side)  
3) Did I stand near multiple low minions right before the engage? (Y/N)

Goal: by game 10, you should feel like “Irelia can’t just randomly kill me anymore.”

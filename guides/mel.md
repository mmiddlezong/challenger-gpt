# Naafiri Mid vs Mel — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Don’t get poked into **Overwhelm execute range**
- Force Mel to waste **W (Rebuttal)**, then take your turn (trade, crash, roam, or call jungle)
- Reach midgame with tempo so you can play **fog → pick → objective**

This matchup is less “can I kill her?” and more “can I **avoid the trap abilities** that stop my all-in?”

---

## Why this matchup is hard
Mel’s kit punishes assassins in 3 ways:

1) **She wins poke wars** with long-range Q/E patterns (chip you down and control the wave).
2) **W (Rebuttal)** makes her briefly *not a real target*: it prevents her from taking damage *and* reflects projectiles back at you.
3) **Passive Overwhelm + R (Golden Eclipse)** means “being low and staying in lane” is extra dangerous:
   - Overwhelm stacks from her damage.
   - If you stay around at low HP while stacks are on you, the next tag can just finish you.
   - Her ult can hit you from far away *as long as you’re affected by Overwhelm*.

So your consistency is about:
- **baiting Rebuttal**
- **dodging Solar Snare**
- and **not overstaying with Overwhelm stacks**

---

## Non‑negotiable rules (follow these and the lane stops feeling doomed)

### Rule 1 — Don’t throw projectiles into Rebuttal (W)
If she presses W:
- **Stop casting Q** (and any other projectile damage you have).
- Back up and wait it out.
- Treat it like a fight reset.

If you keep “trying to finish her” during W, you’ll:
- deal no damage,
- feed reflected damage,
- and get caught by E while your cooldowns are down.

**Learning objective:** Track “Q into W mistakes” every game. Aim for **0**.

---

### Rule 2 — Rebuttal is her “anti-assassin button”… so you bait it first
You don’t need fancy mind games. Use this simple pattern:

- **Walk up with intent** (like you might all-in).
- If she panics and W’s → **back up immediately**.
- Now she’s missing her main defensive tool for a long time early (W is very long cooldown early).

This is where you win lane tempo:
- crash wave
- take a clean recall
- roam
- or coordinate a gank

**Learning objective:** In 10 games, get **at least 1 “baited W”** before minute 10.

---

### Rule 3 — Respect Solar Snare (E): getting rooted is how you lose trades
Her E is a “center root / outer slow + zone damage” tool.
If you get rooted, she can layer Q and passive procs and you lose HP fast.

**Your rule:** Don’t hard-commit in a straight line when E is up.
- Save your dash (E) or W for the moment you’d be rooted or burst down.

**Learning objective:** Review every time you drop below 40% HP — was it because you got rooted? If yes, that’s the thing to fix.

---

### Rule 4 — Drop Overwhelm stacks before you re-enter lane
If she tagged you 2–3 times and you’re not healthy:
- back up for a few seconds,
- let stacks fall off,
- then re-enter.

The “classic Mel death” is:
> You’re low + you keep walking up for 1–2 CS → she tags you once → you die.

**Learning objective:** Any time you’re low, your priority is **reset or stack drop**, not “one more wave.”

---

### Rule 5 — Wave slightly toward you (short lane = safety)
Mel’s poke gets way more oppressive when you’re stuck last-hitting in the middle of lane with no cover.

Default plan:
- last-hit early
- keep the wave closer to your side
- only shove when you’re doing **crash → ward/roam/reset**

---

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)

### Levels 1–2: stabilize, keep HP high
- Don’t eat repeated Q’s trying to “trade back.”
- Last hit calmly and let wave drift toward you.
- You can poke with Q **only when she is not in a W posture** (see next section).

**Win condition:** reach level 3 without being chunked to “one root = dead.”

---

### Levels 3–5: play the “bait W” mini-game
Your lane loop becomes:
1) Farm safely.
2) Step up to threaten.
3) If she uses W → back off.
4) While W is down, you get tempo: push, recall, roam, or call jungle.

**Important:** Don’t force long fights. Mel’s kit is built to punish extended trades with stacking and zoning.

---

### Level 6+: respect global pressure and finishing power
From 6 onward, it’s harder to “fake” being safe at low HP.
If she’s been tagging you with spells and autos, she can threaten a finish even from distance.

Your job:
- don’t sit low in lane
- don’t all-in into W
- look for your windows when W is down, or when she used E on wave

---

## Trading rules: what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed

### Allowed (repeatable, low risk)
- **Short Q poke → back off** (especially when she’s last-hitting)
- Trade when she uses E/Q on the wave and you can answer without walking into her zone
- “Threaten → bait W → take tempo” (this is your best skill in the matchup)

### Forbidden (how Naafiri players throw this lane)
- Q into W (you lose HP and accomplish nothing)
- R committing while W is active (you’ll get no damage and eat counterplay)
- Standing inside the E zone trying to “DPS through it”
- Staying at low HP in lane while she’s been stacking on you

---

## How to play around Rebuttal (W) specifically
Think of W as:
- **a shield**, 
- **a parry**, 
- and a “you can’t touch me” button.

When it’s up:
- you’re not trying to win the trade
- you’re trying to **not lose the game**

When it’s down:
- that’s your “assassin window.”

**Simple rule:**  
> If W is down and you can avoid E, she is punishable. If W is up, your job is to farm and wait.

---

## Jungle interaction (how you actually get leads)
Mel is punishable when:
- she steps up to poke you with no W available
- the wave is on your side
- she uses E aggressively (misses or uses on wave)

**Your communication habit:**
- ping when her W is used (even just for yourself)
- if you can hold wave near your side, your jungler has a real play

---

## Midgame plan (you win by tempo, not by perma‑dueling)
Mel generally wants:
- to sit mid, clear, poke, and group for fights where she can tag multiple champs.

You win by:
- crashing mid wave → disappearing into fog
- threatening side picks
- forcing her to either follow into fog (danger) or give up map control

Against Mel, your best “carry” pattern is often:
> **Don’t fight her front-to-back. Kill the people around her.**

---

## Common death patterns (and the fix)

1) **“I threw Q into W and lost half my HP”**  
   Fix: hard rule — *no projectiles into W*. Wait it out.

2) **“I ulted, did no damage, then got rooted and died”**  
   Fix: only hard-commit after W is used, or when you’re sure you can kill through her tools.

3) **“I was low but stayed for one more wave and got finished”**  
   Fix: drop stacks / reset earlier. Don’t overstay at low HP.

4) **“I got rooted (E) and the lane became unplayable”**  
   Fix: hold dash/W to avoid the root moment; don’t path in a straight line when she’s fishing for it.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Bait W. Don’t Q into W. Dodge E. Drop stacks. Commit only when W is down.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track only these 3 things:

1) **Rebuttal discipline:** How many times did I cast Q into W?  
   Target: **0**

2) **Bait success:** Did I bait W before minute 10? (Y/N)  
   Target: **Yes in 7/10 games**

3) **Death review:** Every death, label it:
   - (A) committed into W
   - (B) got rooted by E
   - (C) overstayed low with stacks
   - (D) jungle collapse / vision error

Whichever label shows up most becomes your next practice focus.

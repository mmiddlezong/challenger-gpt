# Naafiri vs Orianna (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Orianna spell threats (very concise)

- **Passive (Clockwork Windup):** autos hurt more the longer she hits the *same* target — don’t take extended “auto wars”.
- **Q (Command: Attack):** moves the Ball + damages along the path. **Not CC**, but it *sets up* everything else. **If the Ball is near you, you are in danger.**
- **W (Command: Dissonance):** AoE damage around the Ball + leaves a field that **SLOWS you** and speeds allies. Main poke + chase/escape tool.
- **E (Command: Protect):** puts Ball on an ally + **shields** them + grants resists; also damages along the Ball’s travel path. Enables “surprise Ball” positioning.
- **R (Command: Shockwave):** AoE around the Ball that **PULLS/LAUNCHES (knock-up style CC)** enemies toward the Ball after a short delay. **This is the spell you must respect and play around.**

**Two rules that prevent 80% of deaths:**
1) **Never stand in Shockwave range when the Ball is on you or on a nearby diver/frontliner.**  
2) **Hold Naafiri W specifically to dodge Shockwave** (untargetable window) — don’t waste W for “just movespeed” if Orianna R is up.

## Matchup identity: what you’re playing for

Orianna is a control mage who wins by:
- keeping the wave stable,
- poking you down with Ball + W,
- and turning skirmishes/teamfights with **Shockwave**.

Naafiri wins this matchup by:
- **staying healthy** through early levels (so you still have threat),
- using **wave/tempo** (crash → ward/roam/reset),
- creating **high-probability kill windows** (usually post-6) by forcing/avoiding Shockwave,
- and **not giving Orianna a clean 5v5 ball delivery** later.

You are not required to solo-kill her every game. You are required to **not fall behind** and to **convert lane control into map pressure**.

## Key concepts to internalize

### 1) “Ball tracking” is your laning minimap
Every trade decision starts with: **Where is the Ball right now?**
- **Ball on Orianna:** safer to walk up and last hit (still respect Q).
- **Ball sitting in the lane near you:** don’t stand in its radius; she can W slow you or R you.
- **Ball on a minion wave / shoved forward:** she’s often looking to Q→W the wave and poke you at the same time.

A big skill jump in this matchup is learning to “feel” Shockwave range without thinking.

### 2) Your W is a purpose-built anti-Shockwave tool
Naafiri W gives a brief **untargetable** window. Against Orianna, think of W as:
- **your insurance vs R**, and
- the button that lets you commit without donating your life.

If you W at random and then get Shockwaved, you’ll feel like the matchup is “impossible” even when it isn’t.

### 3) Packmates don’t “block” Orianna’s kit
Orianna’s Ball spells are not the kind of linear CC skillshots that get stopped by bodies.
Your pack is damage/pressure — not a shield.

## Lane plan (by levels)

### Levels 1–2: “Spend HP like it’s a resource you can’t refill”
**Goal:** get level 3 with good HP and decent CS.

**What Orianna wants:** auto you whenever you last-hit, then Q/W poke if you’re predictable.

**Your plan:**
- Last hit with Q when needed; don’t walk up into free auto range for every minion.
- Avoid long trades (her passive autos + ball poke win long lanes).
- If she’s consistently autoing you, thin the wave so it doesn’t grow into a huge crash that forces you to tank poke under tower.

**Red flag:** You’re at 60% HP before level 3. That usually means you’re letting her auto you for free.

---

### Levels 3–5: “Wave state > ego trades”
**Goal:** create clean crash timers and avoid being poked down while stuck in lane.

**Your best consistent pattern:**
1) **Let the wave come slightly toward you** (especially early) so you aren’t exposed to jungle + W slow.
2) Build a **slow push** when Orianna uses Q/W on the wave.
3) **Crash** a stacked wave, then choose: ward / reset / roam.

**Trading priorities:**
- **Punish W usage.** When Orianna uses W to clear or poke and you don’t get chunked, you get a small window where she’s less safe.
- Don’t dash first unless she already used a key spell or you have jungle pressure.

---

### Level 6+: “Commit only when Shockwave is handled”
**Goal:** convert one good window into plates/objectives and keep tempo.

Your all-in attempts should be built around one of these conditions:
- **Shockwave is down**, OR
- you are confident you can **W-dodge Shockwave**, OR
- your jungler has CC and you can force Orianna to choose between using R defensively (and you dodge) or dying.

**If Shockwave is up and you can’t dodge it, treat Orianna like a tower:** you don’t dive it without a plan.

---

## How to trade (micro rules that actually work)

### Safe poke / chip pattern
- Use Q to tag her when she steps up for a last hit.
- Back off immediately — don’t stand in Ball radius to “get one more auto”.

You win this matchup by accumulating **small, safe advantages** until your all-in is guaranteed.

### “Punish Q used on wave” window
If Orianna Q’s the wave and the Ball is now sitting forward:
- Step to the **side** of the Ball (not directly in line with the wave).
- Threaten a short trade, but keep your exit path open.
- If she W’s to disengage, you got what you wanted (W cooldown spent).

### Don’t E forward unless you’re sure
E is great as:
- a dodge tool,
- a finish tool,
- or a reposition after you’ve already forced a key Orianna cooldown.

E is risky as an opener because Orianna can:
- W slow you in Ball zone,
- shield herself/ally with E,
- and threaten Shockwave if you’re in range.

## All-in execution: how to avoid donating your life

### The *clean* kill setup
You want Orianna to be:
- **chunked** (not full HP),
- **without a clean Ball position** (Ball not already on you),
- and either missing Shockwave or forced to cast it predictably.

**How it typically looks:**
1) Chip her with Q poke over 1–2 waves.
2) Crash wave or catch her when she walks up to thin it.
3) Commit when her spacing is bad and you’re not walking through Ball zone for free.

### Using Naafiri W vs Shockwave: two practical patterns

**Pattern A — Reactive dodge (preferred if your reactions are good)**
- You commit and keep W **held**.
- The moment you see/expect Shockwave, press **W** to go untargetable and “drop” the CC window.
- Then continue the all-in while she’s missing her biggest tool.

**Pattern B — Pre-buffer (best vs Orianna players who insta-R on engage)**
- If Orianna always presses R immediately when you go in, you can W **right before** you hard commit so you’re untargetable during the “first contact” moment.
- Downside: good Oriannas will *hold* R until after W ends, so don’t autopilot this.

**Rule:** Don’t use W early unless you know *why* you’re using it.

## Jungle interaction & vision (what matters vs Orianna)

### When you’re being shoved
Orianna is great at keeping you under tower and calling jungle through the W slow zone.

**Your job:**
- Ward early enough that you see the gank *before* you’re slowed.
- Play the lane slightly on your side when you don’t have vision.

### When you have a slow push
This is where you can actually win the matchup consistently:
- Stack a wave → crash → ward deep / help your jungler / roam.
- Even if you don’t kill Orianna, you’re forcing her to choose between contesting your move or losing minions.

---

## Roaming vs Orianna (how to not get punished)

Orianna clears waves well and loves to take plates if you roam poorly.

**Only roam when:**
- you crashed a wave, or
- the wave is bouncing back to you and she can’t instantly take your tower.

**If you roam without a crash:**
- expect to lose a wave and possibly a plate,
- and you’ll come back to lane behind and low tempo.

**Best roam timing:** right after a cannon-wave crash (takes her longer to clear + you lose less).

---

## Mid/Late game: how you play fights vs Orianna

Orianna wins games off **one Shockwave**.

As Naafiri you win by:
- **not clumping**, and
- **not entering the fight on her terms**.

### Your teamfight checklist
- Where is the Ball? (on Orianna vs on an ally)
- Is Shockwave up?
- Who can deliver Ball into your team (engagers/divers)?
- Can you approach from a flank so you don’t walk through Ball zone?

### Your best fight pattern
- Hover off-angle.
- Wait for Shockwave to be used (or force it onto someone else).
- Then assassinate the carry or Orianna herself.

If Shockwave is held and you dive first, you’re gambling.

## Learning objectives (focus games for this matchup)

### Objective 1 — Ball tracking reps (every game)
**In lane, say out loud (or mentally):** “Ball on Ori / Ball forward / Ball on me / Ball on ally.”  
If you can’t answer, you’re not allowed to all-in.

**Review metric:** How many times did you take damage because you forgot where the Ball was?

### Objective 2 — W discipline (5-game block)
**Rule:** You may only use W in lane if:
- you are dodging Shockwave,
- you are dodging a gank/critical spell,
- or you are committing to a kill with a clear plan.

**Review metric:** How many times did you die with W available? How many times did you W for speed and then get R’d?

### Objective 3 — “Crash → choose” tempo (10 games)
After every crash, you must do one:
- ward,
- roam,
- reset.

No standing mid “thinking”.

**Review metric:** Did you get punished (plate/CS loss) for roams without a crash?

### Objective 4 — Clean all-in conditions (10 games)
You may only all-in Orianna if **2+** are true:
- Shockwave down OR you are holding W to dodge it
- Orianna below ~70% HP
- Ball not already threatening you (not sitting on your path)
- You know where enemy jungler is (or you have vision)
- Your wave state won’t punish you (crash/bounce)

**Review metric:** Was your engage a plan or a feeling?

---

## Common mistakes (and fixes)

- **Mistake:** You walk through the Ball to last-hit → eat Q/W poke.  
  **Fix:** last hit from angles that don’t put you in Ball radius; be willing to give 1 minion to keep HP.

- **Mistake:** You use W for speed → Orianna holds R → you get Shockwaved after W ends.  
  **Fix:** hold W until you see the threat, or pre-buffer only when you’re confident she insta-R’s.

- **Mistake:** You roam without crashing → Orianna takes plates → you “feel useless”.  
  **Fix:** roam on cannon crashes or after a stacked wave crash only.

- **Mistake:** You take long trades into her passive autos + shield.  
  **Fix:** keep trades short and leave immediately.

## Quick lane checklist (print this in your head)

1) Where is the Ball?  
2) Is Shockwave up?  
3) Is the wave safe (near me / crashable)?  
4) Do I have W available to dodge the one spell that matters?  
5) If I move, do I lose more than I gain?

If you follow that checklist, this matchup becomes a controlled, repeatable lane instead of a poke nightmare.

# Naafiri Mid vs Ahri — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Don’t get “picked” by **Charm** (that’s how Ahri creates kills)
- Get to midgame with tempo so you can play **fog → picks → objectives**
- Accept that post-6, Ahri is often **hard to solo-kill** if she plays well—so you win by **windows + map**, not by perma-dueling

---

## Why this matchup is hard (what you’re actually fighting)
Ahri beats assassins by:
- **Fishing Charm** (1000 range, 12s CD, knockdown + charm + 65% slow) → if it hits, you usually lose the trade hard or die.  
- **Orb of Deception** poking + waveclear (magic out, true damage back) → if you eat the return, your HP disappears.  
- **Spirit Rush** giving her multiple dashes (3 baseline casts, can store more during the window when she consumes essence) → she can dodge your commit or kite your chase.

So your whole lane is:
> “Deny Charm hits, deny Orb return value, keep the lane short, then take turns when her key tools miss.”

---

## Ability cheat sheet (only the parts that matter for Naafiri)
### Ahri E — Charm (the matchup)
- 1000 range projectile, **knockdown + charm + 65% slow**, 1.2–1.8s disable duration, 12s cooldown.  
**Translation:** it’s a *dash-stopper* and a kill starter.

### Ahri Q — Orb of Deception
- Magic damage on the way out, **true damage on the way back**.  
**Translation:** if you stand on the return path, you lose the trade even if you “dodged the first part.”

### Ahri R — Spirit Rush
- 3 dashes baseline in a window (recast twice more), bolts hit nearby enemies; consuming essence during R extends window and can grant extra recasts (stores up to 3).  
**Translation:** she can dodge your all-in, and she can keep chasing if she gets a takedown.

### Ahri passive — Essence Theft
- Sustain after 9 minion/monster kills; extra heal on takedown within 3 seconds of damaging.  
**Translation:** tiny poke often gets “erased” over time. You want **meaningful chunks** or **tempo**, not endless small trades.

---

## Non-negotiable rules (if you follow these, you stop “failing”)
### Rule 1 — Treat Charm like a red light
If Charm is up and you’re in a straight line:
- don’t dash forward
- don’t ult directly at her
- don’t walk into open space without minions/angles

**Your life improves instantly** when you assume “Charm is always coming.”

### Rule 2 — Don’t dash *into* a dash-stopper
Charm includes **knockdown**. If you telegraph a dash (E/R) from max range, you are inviting her to stop it.

Your plan is:
- **bait Charm first**, or
- hold Naafiri W to dodge it, *then* commit.

### Rule 3 — Never eat “free Orb return”
When she throws Q:
- dodge the outgoing
- then immediately think: “where is the return line?” and **step off it**

Many players dodge the first pass and still lose half HP to the true-damage return.

### Rule 4 — Keep the wave slightly toward you
Short lane = safer vs Charm + R chase.
Default: last-hit early, thin waves safely, and only shove for a purpose (crash → ward/roam/reset).

### Rule 5 — Your W is your Charm answer (not a tempo button)
Most Naafiri deaths into Ahri happen because:
- you W for speed/tempo,
- then Charm hits you with no answer,
- and you lose the whole lane.

For consistency: **hold W to deny the Charm moment** (or to deny the burst after it hits).

---

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)

### Levels 1–2: HP preservation > winning trades
- Farm calmly.
- Stand behind minions and avoid straight lines.
- Don’t take repeated Q poke trying to “hit back.”

**Win condition:** reach level 3 with enough HP to threaten wave control.

### Levels 3–5: play “miss Charm = my turn”
Your lane is now a simple turn-based game:

**If Ahri misses Charm:**
- you get to walk up, Q poke, shove, or crash → roam/ward/reset.

**If Ahri holds Charm:**
- you farm and keep the wave safe.
- you don’t dash in a straight line.

**What to do when she uses Q on wave:**
- it’s a small timing window to step up (but still respect Charm).

### Level 6+: accept she’s slippery, win with windows
Once she has Spirit Rush:
- solo kills are harder
- your “good plays” are often **crash + roam**, or **2v2 with jungler**, not 1v1 hero fights

If you do commit, commit only when:
- Charm just missed, OR
- she already spent a dash (or two), OR
- you have jungle/teammate follow-up

---

## Trading rules (what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed)

### Allowed (repeatable, low risk)
- **Short Q poke → back off** (especially after she misses Charm)
- Thin/crash waves with safe spacing
- “Threaten engage → bait Charm → take tempo” (push/recall/roam)

### Forbidden (classic Naafiri throw patterns)
- Dashing directly toward Ahri while Charm is up
- Chasing her through open lane while she still has Spirit Rush charges
- Eating Orb return because you tunneled on last-hitting/trading

---

## How to actually “take turns” in this matchup

### Your best window is **after Charm misses**
When Charm misses, Ahri’s threat drops massively for a short time.
Use that time to do one valuable action:
1) crash the wave (deny her freedom)
2) take a reset (buy + return with tempo)
3) ward deep (so you can play aggressive safely)
4) roam (if side lane is gankable)

**Do not** waste the window on random autos.

### Your second-best window is **when she uses Q to clear**
But still don’t dash in a straight line—Charm is still the real danger.

---

## Playing vs Spirit Rush (the “don’t chase forever” rule)
Ahri’s R lets her reset spacing multiple times. Your job is:
- don’t spend all your tools trying to hit her once
- instead, either:
  - burst quickly when her defensive tool is down (Charm missed / R partly spent)
  - or switch targets and win the fight elsewhere

**Simple rule:**
> If she still has dashes and you don’t have a guaranteed kill, stop chasing and take the wave/objective/rotation instead.

---

## Jungle & vision (how this matchup actually snowballs)
Ahri + jungle is scary because:
- Charm sets up ganks extremely well
- if you’re pushed with no vision, you can die without “making a mistake,” just by being in the wrong lane state

So:
- if you’re pushing, do it with a clear plan and warding
- lean to the warded side
- if you don’t see the jungler and Charm is up: **don’t trade**, don’t dash

---

## Midgame plan (how Naafiri wins the matchup)
Ahri is great at:
- catching rotates with Charm
- skirmishing with Spirit Rush mobility
- playing front-to-back with pick threat

You win by:
- pushing a wave → disappearing into fog
- threatening picks on side lanes/carries
- showing up first to objectives and punishing face-checks

Also: don’t tunnel on killing Ahri.
Often the best carry play is:
> “Ignore Ahri’s slipperiness and delete her ADC/support when Charm is down or used.”

---

## Common death patterns (and the fix)
1) **“I dashed in and got Charms-stopped”**  
   Fix: bait Charm first or hold W to dodge it.

2) **“I dodged Q out but ate Q back and lost lane”**  
   Fix: always dodge the *return line* too.

3) **“I chased her through 2–3 dashes and died to counterplay/jungle”**  
   Fix: if R charges are still up and kill isn’t guaranteed, stop chasing and take tempo instead.

4) **“I used W for speed and had no answer for Charm”**  
   Fix: W is your Charm answer in this matchup; don’t spend it casually.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Charm is the lane. Don’t dash into it. Dodge Q return. Wave toward me. Punish missed Charm with tempo.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track ONLY these 3 things:

1) **Charm hits:** How many times did I get hit by Charm before minute 10?  
   Target: **0–1**

2) **Dash discipline:** Did I ever dash/ult in a straight line while Charm was up? (Y/N)  
   Target: **No in 8/10 games**

3) **Orb return:** How many times did I eat the Q return damage?  
   Target: **0–2 total** (and trending down)

If you fix these, the matchup stops feeling like “Ahri always beats me,” and starts feeling like “she has to outplay me to win.”

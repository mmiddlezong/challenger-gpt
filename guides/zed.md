# Naafiri Mid vs Zed — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **Don’t die to lane all-ins**
- Make Zed spend **W** defensively or on low-value poke
- Hit midgame with tempo so you can play picks and objective setups

This matchup is about **cooldown windows** + **not giving double-shuriken angles**.

---

## Why this matchup is hard
Zed’s lane revolves around:
- **W (Living Shadow)** to create a second angle for poke and to escape
- **R (Death Mark)** all-in that becomes lethal if he lands follow-up damage cleanly

If you don’t track W, you’re letting him control the lane for free.

---

## Non‑negotiable rules
### Rule 1 — Wave slightly toward you
You want a shorter lane so:
- he can’t chase far after W poke / R
- he’s gankable if he W’s forward

Actions:
- early: last-hit more than you auto
- only shove when you’re about to **reset/roam** and you have vision

### Rule 2 — Deny the “double Q line”
Zed’s poke is worst when he can line up Q from **him + shadow**.

Positioning habits:
- Stand behind minions when possible.
- Don’t stand in a straight line with his shadow and your champion.
- When W is cast: **sidestep first**, then decide whether to trade.

### Rule 3 — When Zed uses W, it’s your turn
W has a long cooldown early; when it’s down, he’s much less threatening.

After he uses W to poke:
- don’t fight inside the shadow zone
- dodge, reset spacing
- then use the window to:
  - push safely
  - reset
  - roam with tempo
  - ping jungler for punish

### Rule 4 — Save your W for lethal moments (especially level 6)
Your W is not just a speed buff here. Treat it like a parry button to deny the burst window.

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)
### Levels 1–2
- Keep HP high. Don’t take free Qs trying to auto him.
- Let wave drift slightly toward you.

### Levels 3–5
- The matchup swings on W usage.
- If he holds W: play safely and farm.
- If he uses W aggressively: **dodge**, then take your “my turn” window.

### Level 6+
- Respect the all-in if you’re low HP or wave is far from your tower.
- Your entire defensive job during Death Mark is to **minimize damage during the mark window** by dodging the follow-up pattern.

## What to do when Zed ults you (Death Mark)
Goal: make his follow-up miss or be weak.

Simple response:
1) As he appears, immediately **move sideways** (don’t run in a straight line).
2) **Hold W** for the moment the real burst would connect (often the shuriken timing).
3) Use **E** after to reposition and exit the danger zone.

Two common mistakes:
- W too early (then you eat the real burst)
- panic committing onto him (he swaps and you’re stranded)

---

## When you can kill Zed
You usually win trades / kill windows when:
- he wastes W (no clean second angle)
- he’s chipped down to a threshold where your burst is reliable
- you can commit without getting collapsed on

Best punish pattern:
- survive W poke → push/tempo/reset → threaten roams/picks while he’s waiting on cooldowns

---

## Common death patterns (and fixes)
1) **“I got poked down and then he ulted me”**  
   Fix: stop eating W+Q patterns; keep wave toward you; back off when W is up and you’re low.
2) **“I fought him inside his shadow zone”**  
   Fix: first dodge and reset spacing; don’t take the brawl in his optimal area.
3) **“I used W for speed and died to the all-in”**  
   Fix: W is for the lethal burst window, not for random tempo.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Wave toward me. Sidestep shadow angles. When W is down, it’s my turn. Save W for R burst.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track only these three stats:
1) How many times did I get hit by W-based poke (W+E+Q pattern)?  
2) Did I punish W usage with a push/reset/roam/ping?  
3) On every Zed R, did I save W for the burst timing?

Goal: by game 10, you should feel like “Zed isn’t killing me unless I massively misplay.”

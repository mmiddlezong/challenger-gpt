# Naafiri vs Akshan (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell snapshot (what to dodge / respect)
### Akshan — threats (and what you must avoid)
- **Passive – Dirty Fighting:** Double-shot autos. Every **3 hits** (autos + abilities) = bonus damage + **shield** (vs champs).  
  **Avoid:** extended auto trades where he gets 3-hit proc for free.
- **Q – Avengerang:** Boomerang poke that can hit **out + back**, and **reveals** enemies hit.  
  **Avoid:** lining up so it hits you twice; getting tagged before you try to disappear/roam.
- **W – Going Rogue:** **Camouflage** (especially strong near terrain) + roam pressure; has the **revive** mechanic on takedown.  
  **Avoid:** losing track of him when he leaves lane near a wall/brush.
- **E – Heroic Swing:** Grapple to **terrain** and swing while firing a ton of shots (big DPS + reposition).  
  **Avoid:** fighting near side-walls when E is up; chasing him along terrain.
- **R – Comeuppance:** Long-range **execute** channel. Shots hit the **first unit/structure** in the line, and the ult **cancels if the target becomes untargetable**.  
  **Avoid:** running in open space at low HP. Break line-of-fire with minions/terrain, or cancel it with your W timing.

**Crowd control:** Akshan has **no hard CC**, but he wins lane through damage + spacing.

### Naafiri — tools you use in this matchup
- **Q – Darkin Daggers:** Safe last hits + poke + heal = your early-lane stability.
- **W – The Call of the Pack:** **1s untargetable** (you + pack) + AD/MS steroid + pack refresh. This is your **anti-ult / anti-burst timing** button.
- **E – Eviscerate:** Short dash to reposition and “re-center” your pack mid-fight.
- **R – Hounds’ Pursuit:** Targeted **champion-only** engage that is **not blockable**. It’s a real commit—plan entry + exit.

## Matchup identity in one line
**Survive early poke, keep the wave on your side, then punish Akshan’s E/spacing mistakes at level 6 and convert into plates + mid tower.**

Akshan is *very* good at punishing random roams and sloppy lane states because he’s a marksman who takes plates fast. So you need **high-quality tempo**, not “run bot because I’m bored.”

---

## Pre-game plan (30 seconds in loading screen)
1) **Check Akshan summoners.**  
   - **Ignite** = respect all-in damage; don’t get baited into long fights early.  
   - **Barrier** = your first R all-in needs to be cleaner or you play for roam/plates.
2) **Check enemy jungler.**  
   - If it’s an early ganker, your first 3 waves should be extra conservative + ward earlier.
3) **Decide your lane goal:**  
   - **Default:** freeze-ish near your side → punish E → kill at 6.  
   - **If you can’t hold lane health:** crash → reset tempo → repeat.

---

## Setup (runes, summs, start)
### Summoners
- **Flash + Ignite** = strongest kill pressure at 6.
- **Flash + Teleport** = safest tempo (vs heavy poke + if you expect early jungle attention).

### Start item
- **Doran’s Shield** (recommended) — Akshan’s lane is auto-based poke.
- **Long Sword** only if you’re confident you won’t get chipped out.

### Runes (matchup logic, not “one page forever”)
**Page A — Standard assassin tempo**
- Domination keystone + damage minors (your usual Naafiri page)
- Secondary: Sorcery (poke + haste) if you can keep HP, or Resolve if lane is rough

**Page B — Anti-bully (recommended if you struggle in this lane)**
- Secondary **Resolve** with **Second Wind** + **Bone Plating**  
  Goal: stay high HP so Akshan can’t bully you off level 6 windows.

### Skill order (simple + consistent)
- **Level 1: Q**
- **Level 2: E** (safer vs poke + jungle pressure)
- **Level 3: W**
- **Max:** Q → W → E (reliable lane + midgame tempo)

---

## Early lane script (first 6 waves) — *very concrete*
### Wave 1 (Level 1): “Last hit only”
**Goal:** don’t lose 25–40% HP before level 3.

- Stand behind your melee minions; **do not** walk up for autos.
- Use **Q** to secure last hits you’d otherwise miss.
- If Akshan autos you once or twice: **back off immediately**.  
  Deny his 3-hit passive proc (shield + bonus damage).

**Positioning tip:** don’t stand directly behind your wave (he can Q through the wave and hit you twice). Stand slightly **off to the side** so you can sidestep the return.

---

### Wave 2 (hit level 2): “E is for safety, not for ego”
- Take **E at level 2**.
- Use E mainly to:
  - dodge the second pass of Q,
  - avoid eating repeated autos,
  - escape a jungle angle.
- Still avoid long trades. Your damage is fine—your *HP bar* is the resource.

**Ward window (if safe):** around **2:15–2:45** place a ward on the side you’re more exposed to.

---

### Wave 3 (cannon): “Freeze-ish = your best default”
If Akshan is pushing (he usually is), let the wave come to you and set a **freeze-ish** just outside tower range.

**Why this is so strong:**
- Akshan has to walk up to last hit → he becomes gankable.
- He can’t freely E forward without risk.
- You farm safely and keep HP for level 6.

**What you’re waiting to punish:**
- he uses **E aggressively** to trade or to get a better wave state
- he walks up for cannon while extended
- he stands near terrain to threaten E, but you keep the fight **center lane** so E is awkward

---

### Wave 4–5: choose one plan (don’t drift)
**Plan A: Keep freeze + set up gank**
- Ping jungler when Akshan is extended.
- If he E’s forward: take the **short trade** and back off (don’t chase into walls).
- Save E to **follow after** he commits or to dodge Q return.

**Plan B: Slow-push → crash → reset**
Choose this if:
- you’re low HP,
- enemy jungler is hovering mid,
- you can’t realistically freeze.

How:
- Start killing enemy casters to build a wave.
- Crash the stacked wave into tower.
- **Instant reset.** No “standing mid” after crash.

---

### Wave 6 (level 6 online): “Now you’re allowed to threaten”
Once you have R:
- Look for **E-down** windows, or
- all-in when he’s **away from terrain** (no clean swing), or
- coordinate with jungler CC.

If none of those exist, don’t force. Crash → reset → roam/pick later.

---

## Trading patterns that win this lane
### 1) “Q poke + back off” (your bread and butter)
- Q him when he steps up for a last hit
- back off before he gets 3-hit passive + double-shot value

### 2) “Punish Q-on-wave”
When Akshan uses Q to waveclear:
- he’s telegraphed
- he has fewer tools to punish your step-up  
→ use that moment for Q poke or to stabilize wave control.

### 3) “Never chase the E angle”
If Akshan hooks a wall and starts swinging:
- your best play is often **backing up** and re-centering the lane
- chasing along terrain is how you eat max DPS and die

---

## Your all-in game plan (how you kill Akshan)
### The highest % trigger: Akshan E is down
If he used E and doesn’t have it:
- he’s much easier to stick to
- he’s much easier to kill with R

**Clean all-in checklist**
- You have pack with you (don’t fight with dead pack)
- You’re not under enemy tower
- Enemy jungler is not obviously hovering mid
- Akshan is not standing next to a perfect wall swing

**Execution (simple)**
1) Walk up / threaten
2) **R commit**
3) Q for burst + pop
4) Use **E** to stay on him or dodge the return Q
5) **Hold W** as your “I refuse to lose” button (see next section)

### Secondary trigger: he’s in open lane
Even if E is up, if he’s far from good terrain, he can’t get a clean swing. That’s a real window.

### With jungler CC = near-guaranteed
Akshan’s swing can be disrupted by your teammate’s hard CC. If your jungler has reliable CC, your freeze becomes lethal.

---

## W usage vs Akshan (this is the matchup “secret”)
### 1) Cancel Comeuppance (Akshan R)
Akshan R **cancels if the target becomes untargetable**.  
So if he starts channeling R on you:
- step behind minions/terrain **or**
- **press W during the channel** to drop it

### 2) Win the burst race
If you all-in and he tries to “turn” with passive procs + E shots:
- W buys you 1 second where you can’t be targeted
- that often denies enough damage for you to finish the kill or exit

**Discipline rule:** don’t blow W early “for movespeed” unless you’re sure he can’t punish.

---

## Midgame plan (post lane)
### Roam discipline matters more vs Akshan than vs most mids
Akshan takes plates fast. If you roam on a bad wave:
- you lose 1–2 waves
- you lose plates
- you lose control

**Good roam rule:** only roam on a **crash/bounce**, and only when the play is **fast & high-%**.

### What to do when Akshan disappears (W roam)
- **Ping instantly** (don’t wait to confirm)
- Either:
  - hard shove and take plates, or
  - match quickly *only* if you can arrive in time with impact

Matching late is how you lose twice.

---

## Itemization notes (matchup-specific)
- If Akshan is shredding you with autos:
  - consider **early armor boots** to stop the bleeding and keep lane playable.
- If he (and/or his team) has meaningful shields:
  - **Serpent’s Fang** is a strong pickup.
- Your core identity is still assassin tempo:
  - build for picks → convert to towers/objectives

---

## Common mistakes vs Akshan (and fixes)
- **Mistake:** taking long auto trades early  
  **Fix:** short Q trades; deny his 3-hit passive.
- **Mistake:** fighting near walls while E is up  
  **Fix:** keep trades centered; punish when he’s away from terrain or E is down.
- **Mistake:** roaming without crashing  
  **Fix:** Akshan will take plates—crash first or don’t go.
- **Mistake:** dying to Comeuppance in open lane  
  **Fix:** break line-of-fire (minions/terrain) or **W to cancel**.

---

## Quick decision checklist (use every time you think “I can kill him”)
1) **Is Akshan E up?** If yes, is he near a great wall angle?
2) **Do I have enough HP to commit?**
3) **Is the wave state safe (crashed/neutral) if I fight?**
4) **If he presses R, can I cancel it with W or block with minions/terrain?**
5) **After the kill/recall, can I take plates or mid tower?**

# Naafiri Mid vs Katarina — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Keep Katarina **stuck mid** (deny roams) and/or punish every roam with plates + wave loss
- In fights: **don’t give her resets**. If she gets one takedown, she can chain kills.

This matchup is *not* about “out-mechanics 1v1 all game.”  
It’s about **wave/tempo control** + **dagger discipline** + **reset denial**.

---

## Why this matchup feels bad
Katarina is annoying because:
- She doesn’t need to “win lane” to win the game—she can **roam and snowball**.
- Her damage is tied to **daggers** and **resets**.
- You have **no hard CC**, so you can’t just “interrupt her R” on demand.

So your lane priority is:
1) Don’t die to dagger bursts
2) Keep mid prio / deny roams
3) Convert prio into tempo (ward/roam/reset)

---

## Ability mental model (only what matters)
### Dagger zones = danger zones
If a dagger is on the ground, assume:
- if you stand near it, she can Shunpo in and you lose the trade.

### Shunpo (E) is her “GO” and her “OUT”
When she uses E aggressively:
- if she doesn’t get a dagger reset / kill, she’s punishable.

### Resets are the real win condition
Katarina’s passive makes her abilities come back fast after takedowns.  
**Translation:** the first kill in a fight is everything.

---

## Non‑negotiable rules (these stop the bleeding)
### Rule 1 — Never stand on daggers
Your #1 job is to not donate free dagger damage.

**Action rule:**  
If you see a dagger land near you → take **two steps away** immediately.  
Don’t “finish the last hit first.” That greed is how you lose lane.

### Rule 2 — If she uses E and doesn’t instantly win, you punish
When Katarina Shunpos onto you or onto a dagger:
- your first move is **exit the dagger zone**
- your second move is **hit her back** (Q poke, then decide if you can commit)

If she E’s to farm or poke and you don’t punish at all, she gets to scale/roam for free.

### Rule 3 — Mid prio is your main weapon
Katarina wants to leave lane. Your job is to make leaving expensive.

If she roams and you don’t:
- **hard shove** and take plate(s)
- make her lose a full wave
- drop a ward / take raptors if safe

### Rule 4 — Don’t fight her in river with no wave/vision
Katarina’s best fights are messy skirmishes where she can clean up.
If you don’t know where their jungler is, don’t “meet her halfway.”

### Rule 5 — Your W is not just a speed buff here
Use W as:
- a “buy time / reposition” button in dagger zones
- a way to survive her burst window so she doesn’t get resets

If you W for tempo randomly and then she commits, you’re vulnerable.

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)

### Levels 1–2: shove *with discipline*
Katarina’s early waveclear is usually worse than yours.  
Your goal is to get **lane control** without inting to jungle.

- Last hit + light Q poke
- If you can safely push: do it and crash early
- Ward one side early if you’re going to perma shove

**Win condition:** crash wave, reset/ward, come back with tempo.

### Levels 3–5: “dagger discipline” phase
This is where most Naafiri players throw:
- they get impatient,
- step on a dagger,
- eat a big trade,
- lose lane control.

Your loop:
1) keep the wave manageable (ideally pushing into her)
2) avoid dagger zones
3) punish E usage that doesn’t win

### Level 6+: respect her snowball button
Post-6, Kat is much scarier in skirmishes and side roams.

Your priorities:
- keep wave shoved when you can do it safely
- hover the side she wants to roam to (with vision)
- don’t chase deep if you can’t kill immediately

---

## Trading rules (what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed)

### Allowed (repeatable, low risk)
- Q poke when she walks up to last-hit (then back off)
- Short trades **after she uses E**
- “Hit → disengage” trades where you never stand on the dagger

### Forbidden (how you donate kills)
- Fighting inside dagger zones
- Taking extended melee auto fights after she’s set up daggers
- Chasing her through minion waves / toward fog while her E is up

---

## Roam control: the “Katarina checklist”
Every time Katarina leaves lane, do this quickly:

1) **Ping missing + danger** (bot/top + river)
2) Ask: **Can I match and arrive on time?**
   - If YES: follow on the safe path (don’t facecheck).
   - If NO: **hard shove** immediately.
3) While shoving, decide: plate vs reset vs ward

**Consistency rule:** Matching late is the worst outcome (you lose wave AND you don’t save your team).

---

## Midgame & teamfights (how you stop her from 1v9ing)
Katarina’s dream fight:
- someone gets chunked low,
- she enters late,
- gets 1 reset,
- chains the whole team.

Your counter:
- **burst her fast when she shows**
- or **force her out before the cleanup**
- and keep your team from clumping on daggers

### Practical fight rules
- Don’t stack on top of each other when she’s in fog.
- If she jumps in and starts channeling R:
  - if you can kill quickly, do it
  - if you can’t, **leave the zone** immediately (don’t “tank it”)

### Target selection mindset
Sometimes the best play isn’t “kill Katarina first.”  
If she hasn’t committed yet:
- kill the easier carry/support
- keep your HP high
- don’t give her a low-health reset target

---

## Common death patterns (and fixes)
1) **“I was winning, then I stepped on a dagger and lost half my HP”**  
   Fix: dagger = hazard. Move first, think later.

2) **“She roamed, got double kill, lane is over”**  
   Fix: track roams earlier (vision + wave prio) and punish roams hard when you can’t match.

3) **“I followed but arrived late and died too”**  
   Fix: if you can’t arrive on time, don’t follow. Shove + plate.

4) **“Teamfight: she got one reset and the fight exploded”**  
   Fix: fight spread + protect low HP teammates + burst her on entry.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Never stand on daggers. Punish bad E. Keep mid prio. Don’t match roams late. Don’t give resets.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track ONLY these 3 things:

1) **Dagger deaths:** How many times did I take a big losing trade because I stood on/near a dagger?  
   Target: **0–1 per game → trending to 0**

2) **Roam response:** Every Kat roam, did I either (A) match early or (B) shove + plate?  
   Target: **Yes in 8/10 roams**

3) **Reset prevention:** In teamfights, did Kat get a reset off *my* death or a low-health teammate near me?  
   Target: **Reduce to near 0** (this is awareness + spacing)

If you clean these up, the matchup becomes way more controllable—even without hard CC.

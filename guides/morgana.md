# Naafiri vs Morgana (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell danger snapshot (read this first)

### What *kills you* (Morgana)
- **Q – Dark Binding (ROOT)**: long-range skillshot that **roots for a long time**.  
  **If you get hit, you usually lose Flash or die to a gank.** Play behind minions and be ready to **W-dodge**.
- **R – Soul Shackles (TETHER → STUN)**: tethers you, slows, then **stuns after a delay** if you stay in range.  
  **Do not “keep fighting while tethered.”** Break it with **E distance** or **W untargetable**.
- **E – Black Shield (CC immunity)**: grants a magic shield and **CC immunity while it holds**.  
  **Important:** your damage is mostly physical, so you often **cannot “break” the shield** quickly.  
  This is why Morgana is annoying with/against jungler CC.

### The tools you use to survive + punish (Naafiri)
- **W – The Call of the Pack (1s untargetable)**: your **anti-Binding button** and a way to **drop/break tether timing**.
- **E – Eviscerate (dash)**: your **spacing tool** to dodge Q angles and **break Morg R tether range**.
- **R – Hounds’ Pursuit (targeted commit)**: champion-only engage. You must **plan the next 10 seconds** (Q dodge + tether break).

---

## Matchup identity in one sentence
**Morgana wants to perma-shove and fish for one Q that lets her jungler win the lane; you want to stay healthy, deny Q angles, then win through tempo (crash → roam/reset) and punish missed Q / wasted E.**

---

## Pre-game setup (high consistency)

### Summoners
- **Flash + Ignite** if you want solo-kill threat at 6 and snowball.
- **Flash + Teleport** if the enemy jungle matchup is scary and you want guaranteed tempo resets.

### Start
- **Doran’s Shield** (most consistent) if you expect to eat W tick damage or you’re learning the matchup.
- **Long Sword + Refillable** if you’re confident in your dodging and want earlier kill pressure.

### Boots
- **Early Boots** are premium here because Morgana Q is dodgeable and boots turn “coinflip” into “never hit.”

### One item that changes the matchup
- **Edge of Night** (spell shield) is extremely valuable later because it can block **Q** (and sometimes forces Morgana to waste spells).  
  Don’t rush it every game, but keep it in mind when the enemy comp has multiple pick tools.

---

## Lane plan: win without “winning lane”

### Your two rules
1. **Never take free Qs.** If you’re not behind minions, you’re taking a risk for no reason.
2. **Don’t spend W for speed unless you know you won’t need it for Q.** You’re not a “run-at-her” champ; you’re a “punish the miss” champ.

---

## First 6 waves lane script (very practical)

> Default assumption: Morgana uses **W** on waves and holds **Q** for you/jungle setup.

### Wave 1 (Level 1)
- Start **Q**.
- **Last hit only**. Let the wave come slightly toward you if she W’s the wave.
- Stand **behind your caster minions** so Q can’t hit you unless she walks into a bad angle.

**Goal:** arrive at level 2–3 with high HP and a manageable wave.

### Wave 2 (Level 2)
- Skill **E** in most games (gives you a real dodge tool).
- If she throws **Q** and misses:  
  ✅ take space, last hit confidently, and look for **Q poke + heal**.  
  ❌ do not hard-force an all-in without wave control.

### Wave 3 (Level 3)
- Take **W**.
- If the wave is pushing into you: hold it near your side and **thin with Q**.  
  This is your safest lane state vs ganks + Binding.
- **Ward timing:** when the wave is stable and you can step out safely (often around when Wave 3 meets / after you thin it).

**Your mindset:** “I’m farming. I’m healthy. I’m un-gankable. I’m waiting for a mistake.”

### Wave 4–5 (your first real “crash-and-choose” window)
You want one clean **crash** that lets you choose:
- ward deeper,
- reset,
- or roam with your jungler.

If Morgana perma-Ws waves, she’ll often overpush. That can give you:
- a safer freeze (if you can maintain it), or
- a bounce that lets you crash later.

### Wave 6 (Level 6 soon)
Now you stop “surviving” and start “threatening.”
- Your kills come from **missed Q**, **wasted Black Shield**, or **jungler appearing**.
- If her Q is up and you don’t have W ready, your R is often a **bad trade** (you commit, she roots, you die).

---

## Trading patterns that work

### The “safe trade” (lane stability)
- **Q1 → back off → Q2 pop** when she steps up to last hit or after she uses W on wave.
- You’re not trying to 100–0; you’re trying to:
  - stay high HP,
  - keep her honest,
  - and create a future all-in threshold.

### The “punish the miss” trade (your best one)
When **Morgana Q misses**:
- Walk up (don’t dash first),
- **W only if she tries to Q again or you’re committing**,  
- **Q1 → Q2 pop**, and hold **E** to dodge her next attempt or to exit.

**Why this works:** missing Q removes her only reliable “stop button,” so she can’t punish your approach.

### What NOT to do
- Don’t E forward just to “start the fight” while Q is up.  
  You’ll get rooted mid-animation or on landing and the trade flips.

---

## All-in / kill windows (Level 6+)

### Your all-in checklist (press R only if you can answer these)
- **Where is the enemy jungler?** (or at least: “not here in the next 3 seconds”)
- **Is Morgana Q down** *or* do you have **W ready to dodge it on reaction**?
- **Do you have a clean exit** if she ults? (E to break tether, or space to disengage)
- **Is the wave state acceptable?** (crashed/neutral so you don’t lose 2 waves + plate)

If you can’t answer these, don’t R. Crash → roam/reset instead.

### A reliable solo-kill pattern (common)
1. Wait for **Q miss** (or bait it by stepping to the side of your minion line).
2. **W (hold for the dodge timing if needed)** → **R** onto her.
3. **Q1 → Q2 pop**, weave autos.
4. If she **R’s you**: **E away** to break tether, then re-enter only if she’s already dying.

### Respect the “Flash + R + Zhonya” line
If Morgana has stopwatch/Zhonya:
- She can **R**, then go stasis, and if you stayed tethered you get stunned after.
- Your response is simple: **leave tether range immediately**. Don’t “try to finish through it.”

## Jungle interaction (this matchup is often about junglers)

### If YOUR jungler is ganking
Morgana’s Black Shield changes everything:
- She can Black Shield herself to ignore your jungler’s CC.
- Your damage won’t remove it quickly (it’s a magic shield).

**So you want one of these:**
- Gank after she used **Black Shield** (track the cooldown).
- An **AP jungler** who can pop the shield quickly.
- A “behind her” angle that forces Flash even without CC.

**Callouts to yourself:**
- “No E used? Don’t force.”
- “Black Shield down? This is the window.”

### If the ENEMY jungler is ganking
Most ganks are: **Morgana holds Q → jungler walks in → Q root → you die.**

How you deny it:
- Keep the wave closer to your side when possible.
- Ward one side and **play to the warded side**.
- When you see them enter, don’t panic-dash forward.  
  **Back behind minions** and hold **W** for the Binding.

---

## Warding plan (simple + effective)

### Default (most games)
- **First ward:** one river pixel brush (the side you plan to play toward).  
  Place it when the wave is stable and you can step out without eating Q.
- **Second ward / Control Ward:** in one of these:
  - your raptor entrance (defensive),
  - the river brush near your chosen side,
  - or the small brush near lane if you’re being camped.

### When you have prio and can move first
- Ward **enemy raptor entrance** or **one of the river-jungle ramps** to see the jungler early.
- Morgana hates fighting you in fog because she has to “guess” Q angles.

---

## Mid game plan (how you actually win vs Morgana)

### 1) Stop perma-laning into her waveclear
Morgana’s job is to clear mid and make you bored.

Your job is:
- catch the wave,
- push it (when safe),
- **disappear** (river/jungle),
- threaten a pick or roam,
- repeat.

### 2) Play around her cooldowns, not her HP bar
- If **Q is up**, she has playmaking.
- If **Q is down**, she’s mostly a W bot with a shield.

Your tempo windows are literally “Q missed → you move first.”

### 3) Objective setup: delete the person placing vision
Morgana will try to walk up and fish for Q in choke points.
You punish by:
- arriving early,
- sitting in fog,
- **W ready**,
- and killing whoever face-checks.

---

## Teamfights: don’t become the assassin who suicides

### Your role vs Morgana
- You are **flank + cleanup**.
- Morgana’s job is to **tag you with Q** or **force you to stay tethered**.

### Fight rules that keep you alive
- **Never enter first through a choke** where she’s aiming Q.
- Approach from an angle where:
  - there are minions/teammates to block Q, or
  - you can see her cast animation and W it.

### Targeting
If Morgana is sitting on her ADC with Black Shield:
- You can still kill the ADC (shield doesn’t reduce your physical damage),  
  but you must assume **you won’t get your slow** and you must **dodge Q**.
- Often the cleaner play is to kill:
  - the “late” rotating mage/marksman,
  - the support placing vision,
  - or the isolated side-laner,
  then take the objective.

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

### “I used W for movespeed and then got Q’d.”
**Fix:** treat W as **Q insurance** first, steroid second.

### “I R’d while Q was up and died.”
**Fix:** R only when:
- Q is down, **or**
- you are mentally ready to W the Binding on arrival.

### “I stayed in Morgana R tether because she was low.”
**Fix:** tether is a timer. If you can’t kill *before* the stun, leave range and re-enter later.

### “I called for ganks but Black Shield denied everything.”
**Fix:** ask for ganks **after** shield is used, or coordinate with AP damage to pop it.

---

## One-screen checklist (use this in-game)

**Lane**
- ✅ Stand behind minions (deny Q angle)
- ✅ Boots early
- ✅ Hold W for Binding
- ✅ Trade after Q miss (Q1 → Q2 pop)

**All-in**
- ✅ Jungler location known
- ✅ Q down or W ready
- ✅ Exit plan vs R tether
- ✅ Wave state not punishing

**Mid game**
- ✅ Push → disappear
- ✅ Play fog near objectives
- ✅ Look for picks on rotations, not front-to-back

---

## Quick practice goals (5 games)
1. **No deaths to gank + Binding.** If you die this way, write down where your ward should’ve been.
2. **Count Q cooldown windows.** Every missed Q = you take space or roam.
3. **Break every Soul Shackles tether.** If you get stunned, review why you didn’t E/W out.

Good luck — once you stop giving Morgana free Qs, this matchup becomes less “annoying” and more “free tempo.”

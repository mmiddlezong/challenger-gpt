# Naafiri vs Azir (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first)

### Azir (what can stop you)
- **Q — Conquering Sands:** repositions all soldiers, deals damage, **slows (25% for 1s)**. This is his main “kite + punish melee” tool.
- **E — Shifting Sands:** **dash to a soldier + shield**. Primary escape. If he has a soldier behind him, assume he can leave.
- **R — Emperor’s Divide:** big soldier wall that **knocks you back** and then blocks movement. This is the “you don’t get to assassinate me” button.

**Things you must avoid:**
- **Getting R’d while you’re between Azir and his tower/team.** That’s how you get “shuffled” into death.
- **Eating Q slow while walking into soldier zone.** If you’re slowed in soldier range, you bleed HP and lose your all-in angle.

### Naafiri (the tools that matter here)
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** gives a short steroid and a **1s untargetable window on cast**. Use it to break a key moment (dodge a decisive spell / drop aggro / buy a beat for packmates).
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** targeted champion commit (no minion escape). Your kills come from timed commits, not yolo dashes.

## Matchup identity in one sentence
**Azir is trying to keep you permanently at arm’s length with soldiers + Q slow + R peel; you win by staying healthy, managing wave tempo, and only committing when his escape/peel is down or mispositioned.**

---

## Recommended setup (consistency-focused)

### Summoners
- **Flash + Ignite** (standard kill pressure)
- If their jungle/support has heavy lockdown and Azir is just free-farming: **Flash + Teleport** is a legit “tempo assassin” option (farm → crash → reset → roam).

### Runes (two reliable pages)
**A) Survive lane → kill later (recommended):**
- **Resolve secondary:** *Second Wind + (your choice: Unflinching / Overgrowth)*
- Pair with your preferred damage primary (Domination/Sorcery) based on comfort.

**B) If you’re confident dodging and want burst:**  
- Standard assassin burst page (Electrocute-style), but you are accepting higher lane variance.

### Start
- **Doran’s Shield** is your friend here. Azir’s repeated soldier hits + Q poke punish greedy starts.

---

## Your win conditions vs Azir
1. **Don’t bleed out early.** If you stay high HP through levels 1–5, you keep the threat of level 6+ kills and roams.
2. **Force “peel tax”:** make Azir spend Q/E/R defensively. Once one of those is down, the lane flips from “you can’t touch him” to “he can’t step up.”
3. **Crash → disappear:** Azir hates walking into fog. Your best games are: push → vanish → threaten side/river picks → re-show on wave.

## Lane plan: first 6 waves (concrete script)

### Wave 1 (Level 1)
- **Goal:** last-hit only, preserve HP.
- Stand outside soldier poke lines. If he spawns a soldier to hit you + wave, don’t “trade back” with autos—you’ll lose more HP than you gain.
- Use **Q primarily to last hit** and to tag Azir only when it’s free.

### Wave 2 (Level 2)
- Expect him to start shaping the wave with soldiers.
- **Do not walk into soldier range to contest a minion** if it costs you 2–3 soldier hits.

### Wave 3 (Cannon wave) → “make the lane livable”
Pick one of these two plans based on how the first two waves went:

**Plan A (most consistent): Let it come to you**
- Thin the wave with Q so it doesn’t crash as a giant stack.
- Let it crash near your tower, then hold a mini-freeze (3–4 enemy caster advantage).
- This makes Azir walk up if he wants to harass, which creates jungle angles and future all-in angles.

**Plan B (only if you’re healthy and he’s sloppy): Crash-and-choose**
- If he mispositions or his early waveclear is weak, you can help shove wave 3 and crash.
- Then you earn a choice: ward river/raptors entrance, reset, or roam.

### Waves 4–6 (Levels 3–5)
- Your lane is not “trade constantly.” Your lane is farm, keep HP, and wait for a punishable cooldown.
- If the wave is on your side: great—Azir has to step up to maintain shove.
- If the wave is stuck mid and you’re taking poke: you need to thin and reset rather than slowly dying.

## Trading rules (how you don’t get chipped to death)

### Rule 1: Never fight in a full soldier setup
If Azir has **2 soldiers positioned to hit you**, you are not “trading”—you are volunteering for DPS.

Your default response:
- Back up, last hit with Q, and wait for his soldier positions to get awkward.

### Rule 2: Track Q like it’s CC (because it is)
His Q slow is what turns soldier hits into real punishment.
If Q is down, you can step up more freely for farm and short trades.

### Rule 3: Your best “trade” is often just Q value
A great lane against Azir looks like:
- Q to last hit + clip him → heal a bit → back out.
You’re aiming for HP stability and wave control, not extended autos.

## When you can actually kill Azir

### The three real kill windows
1. **He used E** (dash) to farm, poke, or reposition, and he’s now immobile.
2. **His R is down** (used defensively in a skirmish or to survive a gank).
3. **He steps up without soldier cover** (or his soldiers are in bad positions), so he can’t kite you through the approach.

### “Bait R” patterns (safe and repeatable)
- **Threaten from fog:** crash wave → disappear → re-enter lane from side. Azir players often panic-hold R; your goal is to make him show it early.
- **2v2 with jungler:** the cleanest Azir kills are often jungle + you. He burns R to peel one of you; the other finishes.

### Your commit checklist (before pressing R)
- Where is the enemy jungler?
- Is Azir’s **E** available (can he dash to a soldier)?
- Is his **R** available (can he knock you away and wall your exit)?
- Do you have an exit plan (E reposition, flash angle, teammate follow)?

If you can’t answer those, don’t commit. Crash → roam → win the map instead.

## Ability usage vs Azir (micro tips)

### W (The Call of the Pack)
- Treat W as your timing button, not a generic movespeed button.
- Best uses in this matchup:
  - Break a critical moment when Azir tries to peel (especially around his R window)
  - Re-center your packmates before you commit (so your damage doesn’t start late)

> Note: “Untargetable” interactions can be timing-sensitive. If you’re trying to W through Azir’s R, test the timing in Practice Tool so you know what your version does.

### E (Eviscerate)
- Hold E to dodge the thing that matters (often Q slow + soldier line), or to reposition after he peels.
- Don’t E forward into a soldier setup unless you’ve already forced his E/R or you have jungle backup.

### R (Hounds’ Pursuit)
- Your best R’s vs Azir are:
  - from fog / flank (less time for him to pre-place soldiers + line up peel)
  - after E is used (no dash)
  - after R is used (no wall knockback)

## Mid game plan (how you actually win the matchup)

### 1) Stop living mid permanently
Azir wants you visible so he can shove and control the river safely. Your job is:
- catch mid wave
- push enough to create a timer
- disappear

### 2) Picks beat “fair fights”
Azir is strong in structured 5v5 where he can stand behind a front line and soldier DPS. You don’t want that.
You want:
- catching rotations
- punishing face-checks
- killing the “late” person arriving to objectives

### 3) Objective setup: arrive early, sit in fog
45–60 seconds before dragon/baron:
- push the nearest mid wave
- control ward a side entrance
- wait

If you’re showing mid when the objective spawns, you’re doing Azir a favor.

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

### Mistake: Forcing all-ins through Q slow + R up
**Fix:** treat Azir R like a “no-go” sign unless you’re 2v1/2v2 or you’ve baited it.

### Mistake: Fighting inside his soldiers “because I’m ahead”
**Fix:** even if ahead, soldier DPS + slow can still chunk you enough that your commit fails. Win with angles, not ego.

### Mistake: Roaming on bad wave states
**Fix:** roam only after crash/bounce. If you roam while your wave is pushing away from you, Azir takes plates and you lose the game on tempo.

## Quick in-game checklist (paste this into your brain)
- Am I healthy enough to threaten level 6?
- Where is Azir’s **Q** (slow) and **E** (dash) cooldown?
- Is his **R** up? If yes: can I force it with jungle / fog pressure instead of committing?
- Did I crash the wave? If yes: ward / roam / reset (no standing mid).

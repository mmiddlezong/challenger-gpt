# Naafiri Mid vs Veigar — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Don’t give Veigar a free scaling lane (he *wants* to farm and stack)
- Create a **tempo advantage** (plates, roams, river control) before Veigar becomes a teamfight monster
- In midgame: win by **fog + picks + flanks**, not by running front-to-back into cage

---

## Why this matchup feels bad (what you’re actually losing to)
Veigar is a scaling mage whose entire game plan is:
- farm safely
- stack AP
- turn midgame fights into “walk into my cage and die”

The matchup hinges on one spell:

### Veigar E — Event Horizon (“the cage”)
If you get stunned by the cage wall:
- you usually eat W + Q + R
- and you can’t play the lane afterward (HP/tempo lost)

So this matchup is less about “can I out-damage him?” and more about:
> **Can I deny cage stuns, force him to waste E, and then take turns?**

---

## Non‑negotiable rules (follow these and you stop hemorrhaging)
### Rule 1 — Never dash *through* the cage wall
Veigar cage punishes dashes. If you cross the wall, you’ll get stunned.

**Translation for Naafiri:**
- Don’t R/E in if cage is available.
- If you’re trapped outside, don’t “panic dash” into it.

If you break this rule, you die even if you’re ahead.

### Rule 2 — “Cage up = red light”
If Veigar’s E is up, you play like:
- you can farm
- you can poke
- you can threaten
…but you **don’t hard-commit** unless he’s already forced to use E.

### Rule 3 — Wave slightly toward you (short lane wins)
Veigar is most dangerous when:
- you’re pushed up
- he cages you
- jungle arrives
- you die with no counterplay

So default lane state should be:
- wave near your side
- you can last-hit safely
- Veigar has to step up if he wants to stack aggressively

### Rule 4 — Don’t stand in his Q “double last-hit line”
Veigar often lines up Q through minions to farm/stacks.
If you stand in that line, you donate free poke.

Simple habit:
- stand slightly off-angle from your minion line
- use minions as a shield, but don’t stand directly behind low minions he’s trying to Q

### Rule 5 — Don’t all-in at low HP post-6
Once Veigar has ult, the “I’m kinda low but I can probably kill” all-in is how you donate shutdowns.

If you’re low, reset. Veigar loves executing overconfident assassins.

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)

### Levels 1–2: build wave advantage without bleeding HP
- Farm cleanly and keep HP high.
- You can pressure with Q when he walks up, but don’t chase.

**Ideal outcome:** wave starts drifting toward you so the lane is short.

### Levels 3–5: play “bait E = my turn”
Your lane becomes turn-based:

**If Veigar uses cage (E) and it doesn’t stun you:**
- you instantly win the next 10–15 seconds of lane
- you can walk up, shove, trade, take a plate, ward, or recall

**If Veigar holds cage:**
- you farm safely and don’t give him a clean angle
- you don’t telegraph dashes

### Level 6+: don’t coinflip into cage + ult
- Expect him to play farther back.
- Your best value is usually **tempo**, not forcing a solo kill.
- Kill windows are mostly: **E down** or **jungler present**.

## Trading rules (what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed)

### Allowed (repeatable, low risk)
- **Short Q poke → back off**
- Walk up to threaten, then back up to bait cage
- Trade after he uses E on wave or whiffs it
- Crash wave → roam/ward/reset (Veigar hates losing tempo)

### Forbidden (how Naafiri players throw this matchup)
- Dashing in while E is up and he’s not forced to use it
- Standing on top of a predictable W drop zone
- Fighting extended trades while he’s kiting you inside/near cage space
- Staying low in lane “for one more wave”

---

## The cage rulebook (the most important part)
### How you avoid getting stunned
- Don’t approach in a straight line.
- Don’t stand close enough that “cage on top of me” is guaranteed.
- Always keep a mental escape route: **to one side**, not straight backward.

### What you do when he cages
1) **If you’re not stunned:** immediately back out of its threat zone.
2) **If you are trapped but not stunned:** don’t dash into the wall; wait for it to expire or walk around safely.
3) **If you are stunned:** accept you’re in danger; don’t panic-spam forward dashes. Your goal is to survive the follow-up, then reset lane.

### How you punish cage being down
When cage is down, Veigar is:
- immobile
- squishy
- very gankable
- and has much less ability to deny your engage

Your punish options:
- shove wave and recall (best consistency)
- roam (if a lane is gankable)
- invade/vision with jungler
- pressure him under tower for plates (only if you see jungler)

---

## Midgame plan (how you “carry” vs Veigar)
Veigar wants 5v5s in choke points.

You want:
- side lane pressure
- fog picks
- forcing him to react to waves

### What to do after lane phase
- Don’t perma-ARAM mid into cage.
- Catch wave → push → disappear.
- Look for isolated targets (support/adc/jungler) rotating through fog.

### How you fight around objectives
- Arrive early and set up vision.
- Don’t walk into river choke blind.
- In fights, wait for cage to be used (or whiffed) before you commit.

**Simple fight rule:**
> If cage is available and you have no flank, you are not allowed to be the first one in.

## Common death patterns (and fixes)
1) **“I dashed into cage and got stunned instantly”**  
   Fix: cage up = red light; commit only after E is forced.

2) **“I got caged + ganked while pushing”**  
   Fix: wave toward you by default; shove only with vision and purpose.

3) **“I was low and tried to all-in and got ulted”**  
   Fix: reset earlier; don’t coinflip at low HP.

4) **“I kept trying to kill Veigar, but he just farmed and scaled”**  
   Fix: win via tempo—roam, plates, objectives, vision; kill *others*.

---

## Quick mental script
> “Cage is the matchup. Wave toward me. Bait E. Punish E down with tempo. Don’t dash through walls.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track ONLY these 3 things:

1) **Cage stuns:** How many times did I get stunned by Event Horizon before minute 10?  
   Target: **0–1**

2) **Wave safety:** Where was the wave for each death/chunk? (my side / mid / his side)  
   Target: deaths should almost never happen on his side.

3) **Tempo conversions:** After Veigar used E, did I do something valuable? (push/plate/ward/reset/roam)  
   Target: **Yes in 7/10 games**

If you fix these, Veigar stops feeling like an inevitable scaling loss and starts feeling like:
> “He has to land cage to matter—and I’m not giving it to him.”

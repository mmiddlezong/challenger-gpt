# Naafiri vs Cassiopeia (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell threat cheat sheet (read this first)

### Cassiopeia threats (what *must* be respected)
- **Q – Noxious Blast:** delayed AoE that **poisons**. If you’re poisoned, she can **E-spam** you for huge DPS and she gets a **movespeed** boost. Your #1 job in lane is to **not get tagged by Q for free**.
- **W – Miasma:** toxic zone that **poisons + slows + GROUNDS** (grounded = you **cannot use dashes/mobility**).  
  **If you are standing in Miasma you cannot use Naafiri E or R**, and in most cases you should assume you also **can’t Flash** while grounded. This is the spell that makes the matchup hard.
- **E – Twin Fang:** point-and-click damage that becomes **rapid-fire** when you’re poisoned and **heals Cass** vs poisoned targets. If you’re poisoned, **do not take extended trades**.
- **R – Petrifying Gaze:** cone ult. **If you’re facing Cass when it hits, you get STUNNED (2s)**; if you’re turned away you get **slowed** instead. This is her “anti-assassin” button.

### Your tools (Naafiri) that matter in this matchup
- **W – The Call of the Pack:** gives **1s untargetable on cast** (midscope kit). This is your best answer to **Cass R** and to “break” her targeted **E** spam for a moment.
- **E – Eviscerate:** short dash/reposition. **Don’t spend it forward** unless Cass W is down, because W can ground you and remove your escape.
- **R – Hounds’ Pursuit:** champion-only targeted dash commit. It’s reliable, but **do not press R while Cass W is available** unless the kill is guaranteed or you have heavy follow-up.

**One-sentence matchup rule:**  
> If Cass can keep you **poisoned** or **grounded**, you lose. Your job is to trade only when you’re **not poisoned**, and commit only when **Miasma (W) is down**.

## What the lane actually is
Cassiopeia is a **DPS control mage** with two things assassins hate:
1) **Grounding (W)** stops your mobility, and  
2) **Facing-based stun (R)** punishes straight-line engages.

So your win is rarely “solo kill her every time.” Your consistent win conditions are:
- **Survive lane with good HP** → hit level 6 with tempo.
- **Crash waves** to roam/invade with jungle (Cass hates walking into fog).
- **Punish her mistakes**: missed Q, wasted W, greedy shove with no wards.
- **Convert**: plates / mid tower / dragon setups, not endless 1v1s.

---

## Setup (runes, sums, start) for consistency

### Starting item
- **Doran’s Shield** if you struggle vs poke/DPS (most players should start this).
- **Long Sword + Refillable** only if you’re confident dodging Q and playing aggressive.

### Summoners
- **Ignite** is best if you have any kill pressure (it helps vs Cass healing on E).
- **Teleport** is acceptable if your goal is “never lose lane, out-tempo with recalls.”

### Runes (two good pages)
**Page A (standard assassin, still stable):**
- Domination: **Electrocute** / Taste of Blood / Eyeball / **Ultimate Hunter**
- Resolve: **Second Wind** / Unflinching (or Overgrowth)

**Page B (if you’re getting bullied hard):**
- Precision: **Fleet Footwork** / Presence of Mind / Legend: Haste / Coup (or Cut Down if they’re tanky)
- Resolve: **Second Wind** / Unflinching

*(If you only change one thing for this matchup, take **Second Wind**.)*

### Skill order
- **Max Q** first.  
- **Level 2 E** most games (lets you dodge Q and manage trades).  
- Save W usage for defensive timing early.

---

## Lane plan: the first 6 waves (script)

### Wave 1 (level 1): “Don’t eat Q”
- Stand **diagonally** to Cass (don’t move in straight lines).
- Last-hit with **Q** when safe; do not walk up for autos if it costs HP.
- If Cass misses Q, you can Q her once (light poke) and back off.

### Wave 2 (level 2): “Respect E spam”
- Cass usually takes **E** and can punish you hard if Q hits.
- If you get poisoned: **immediately disengage** until poison ends.

### Wave 3 (level 3): “Assume she has W soon”
- Many Cass players will take **W early vs dash champions**.
- Play as if W exists once she’s level 3: **no forward E**, no greedy trades.
- **Ward timing:** if you are pushing, place a river/raptor ward around **2:30–3:00**.

### Wave 4: “Start building a crash”
- Your goal is a **clean crash on wave 5** (cannon wave) so you can reset/roam.
- Use Q to thin and keep HP high; don’t “ego trade” into poison.

### Wave 5 (cannon): “Crash → choose”
After you crash:
- **Best default:** reset (buy damage + refill), come back with tempo.
- If you roam, it must be **high %** (ally CC, enemy pushed, clear path).

### Wave 6 (approaching level 6): “Now you can punish”
- Your first real solo-kill threat usually starts **at level 6**, but only if:
  - Cass **misses Q** or uses it on wave, AND
  - Cass **W is down** (or she’s too low to survive), AND
  - you’re not about to lose a big wave for nothing.

---

## Trading rules (this is the whole matchup)

### Rule 1: If you’re poisoned, you’re on a timer
If Cass Q hits you (or you’re in W), she can **E spam**.  
**Your response:**
- Stop trading. Back up. Let poison expire. Reset the situation.

### Rule 2: Never dash forward while Miasma is available
If Cass holds W, any forward E/R is a coinflip:
- She drops W on you → you’re grounded → you can’t E/R out → you get shredded.

So your habit should be:
- **E = dodge tool first**, not engage tool.

### Rule 3: Your “good trade” is short and clean
Best pattern (when Cass Q is down/missed):
- **Q poke (apply bleed) → Q pop → back off**
- If she tries to answer with Q, **E sideways** to dodge (not forward).

### Rule 4: Save W for one of two moments
- **Dodge Cass R** (or at least deny its hit window).
- **Break her E spam** mid-fight (1s untargetable can buy the second you need to exit/finish).

## How to all-in Cass (and when you shouldn’t)

### Green-light checklist before you commit with R
Only press R if **2+** of these are true:
- Cass **W is down** (best) or clearly wasted.
- Cass **Q just missed** or was used on wave.
- Cass is **below ~60%** and you have Ignite.
- Your jungler is nearby / you have follow-up.
- The wave state won’t punish you (crashed or neutral).

### Your cleanest all-in template
1) **Hold E** until you need to dodge Q or reposition out of W.
2) **W** (untargetable + buff) **right before you commit**.
3) **R** onto Cass → **Q** → auto → **E** to dodge/keep contact (only if not grounded).
4) If she ults: **W timing** or **turn away** instantly to avoid stun (slow is still bad, but survivable).

### When to *not* all-in (common bait)
- Cass has **W up**, you don’t have jungle help, and she’s not low.
- Cass has **R up**, and you’re forced to engage straight at her.
- You’re already poisoned at the start of the fight.

If you break these rules, you will feel like “my champ does no damage.”  
It’s not damage—it's **ground + DPS** beating commitment.

## Roaming vs Cass (tempo plan)

Cass clears waves well and loves taking plates if you leave. So:
- **Roam only after a crash** or after forcing her to recall.
- Prefer **short roams** (river invade, raptors ward, hover to a fight) over long walks bot.

### Best roam windows
- Cannon crash (wave 5/10/15...)
- After you chunk her and she must play under tower
- When your jungler is fighting for vision/objective and you can arrive first

### If Cass roams
- Don’t match late. Either:
  - match instantly (if you can arrive in time), or
  - hard shove and take **plates / mid tower damage** + deep vision.

---

## Jungle coordination (how to actually kill her)

Cass has no dashes, so ganks are strong **if you handle Miasma**:
- Ping your jungler to **wait for W** or force Cass to use W defensively.
- If Cass drops W, don’t chase inside it—**re-angle** after it expires.
- Approach from **multiple angles** so she can’t W both you and the jungler path.

---

## Mid game & teamfights (don’t int into her kit)

### What Cass wants
- 5v5 front-to-back in tight chokes (dragon/baron ramps) where W covers the entrance.
- You walking straight at her so R stuns you.

### What you want (Naafiri)
- **Fog picks** on rotations and side lanes.
- Flanks where Cass must choose between:
  - ulting you, or
  - peeling her ADC/support.

### Fight entry rules vs Cass
- Avoid narrow choke points unless your team already has vision control.
- Enter from the **side**, not straight through Miasma.
- If Cass R is up, be ready to **W** or **turn away** on reaction.

Often the best play is **not** to dive Cass first:
- Kill a late-rotating carry/support → objective → then deal with Cass.

---

## Quick mistakes checklist (fix these and the matchup feels playable)

- ❌ **Taking fights while poisoned**  
  ✅ Back off, reset, then re-engage.

- ❌ **E forward before Cass W is used**  
  ✅ Use E to dodge Q; engage only after W is down.

- ❌ **R straight at Cass when she has R**  
  ✅ Flank, W-timing, or turn-away reaction.

- ❌ **Roaming on a bad wave** and losing plates to Cass  
  ✅ Crash first, then move.

---

## Micro cues you can actively look for
- Cass steps forward with confidence → she’s fishing for **Q**. Expect it and sidestep.
- Cass holds W and doesn’t use it → she’s waiting for your dash. **Don’t give it to her.**
- Cass uses W on wave or for zoning → that’s your **biggest punish window** (call jungle, threaten R).

---

## 10-second in-game reminder
1) **Dodge Q**.  
2) If **poisoned → disengage**.  
3) **No dash** until **W is down**.  
4) **W** to answer **Cass R**.  
5) Crash waves → roam/ward/reset.

# Naafiri vs Yone (Mid) — matchup guide

## 10-second spell snapshot (what to respect)

### Your key buttons (Naafiri)
- **Q – Darkin Daggers:** 2 casts, bleed + “pop” damage, **heals** on champ/large monster hit. Your safest trading + sustain tool.
- **W – The Call of the Pack:** short steroid + **~1s untargetable** on cast. **This is your anti-CC timing button**.
- **E – Eviscerate:** short dash + AoE. Use mainly to **sidestep** and to reposition your pack, not as a blind engage.
- **R – Hounds’ Pursuit:** **targeted champion-only** long-range commit. Use to punish mistakes / start picks, not to “test” him.

### What Yone does to kill you (and the CC you must dodge)
- **Q – Mortal Steel:** stacks; **Q3 is a dash + knock-up** (big threat).  
  **Avoid:** standing in a straight line when he has Q3 ready.
- **W – Spirit Cleave:** cone damage + **big shield** (more shield if it hits you + the wave).  
  **Avoid:** trading into the shield or letting him W you and the wave for free.
- **E – Soul Unbound:** he dashes out, gains MS, then **snaps back** to his start point; damage “echoes” at the end.  
  **Avoid:** long DPS trades during his E; he wants repeated Q autos while you can’t disengage.
- **R – Fate Sealed:** long dash + **knock-up** (fight-starting CC).  
  **Avoid:** being in a clean R line when his Q is stacked and he’s posturing.

**Your #1 rule:** **Hold W** to dodge **Q3** or **R**. If you W for movespeed and then eat knock-up, you usually die.

## Matchup identity (how you actually win)

Yone is a **sustained DPS melee** who spikes hard at **level 3 (E)** and **level 6 (R)** and scales into side lanes.  
Naafiri wins this matchup by being a **tempo assassin**:

- **Stable early lane** (don’t donate HP into his all-in timers)
- **Control wave** so his E engages are awkward
- **Punish missed Q3/R** with short burst trades or an all-in
- **Crash → move first** (roams, river picks, objective setup)
- **Convert** (plates/mid tower) so Yone can’t quietly scale

If you try to “out-DPS him in lane,” you’ll flip coin trades into his E + shield.

---

## Setup: runes, sums, starting items

### Summoner Spells
- **Flash + Ignite** (default): best kill threat and snowball.
- **Flash + Exhaust** (safety option): if you’re consistently dying to his level 6 all-in or their comp has multiple divers. Exhaust turns his “one combo = kill” into “I have to outplay.”

### Runes (recommended baseline)
**Domination**
- **Electrocute** (burst window vs his short mistakes)
- Sudden Impact
- Eyeball Collection
- Ultimate Hunter (more R windows = more map pressure)

**Resolve (secondary)**
- **Bone Plating** (massive vs E all-in)
- Second Wind *or* Unflinching (pick based on comfort)

### Starting items
- **Doran’s Shield** (most consistent): best when you’re learning the matchup or vs heavy early trades.
- **Long Sword + Refillable** (greedy): only if you’re confident you won’t get chunked level 1–3.

---

## Lane plan: the first 6 waves (simple script)

### Wave 1 (level 1): “no free Q stacks”
**Goal:** keep HP high and wave near your side.
- Start **Q**.
- **Last-hit only**; let Yone push slightly.
- Take **short Q taps** when he walks up to last-hit (poke + heal), then back off.

**What to watch:** if he’s freely hitting wave with Q, he gets Q3 faster and threatens you sooner.

### Wave 2 (level 2): “respect his trade pattern”
Yone often looks for **Q poke → W shield trade**.
- Don’t stand where his **W hits you + the whole wave**.
- If he uses W on the wave to push, that’s a small window to step up (no shield).

### Wave 3 (level 3): “E is the real lane start”
This is the first lethal spike.
- Assume he wants: **E → Q/Q3 → autos → W → snap back**.
- **Do not** spend **E** forward; keep it to **sidestep Q3** or escape.

**Your best response pattern:**
1. Kite backward so his E time is “wasted walking.”
2. If he commits with Q3 or threatens R later, **hold W**.
3. When E ends and he snaps back, **re-take space** and re-establish the wave.

### Waves 4–6 (levels 4–5): “wave control > ego trades”
Pick one of these plans:

**Plan A (default, safest): hold a small freeze near your tower**
- Yone has to walk up.
- His E trades are shorter (less room to chase).
- Your jungler has easier gank angles.

**Plan B (only if you’re healthy + tracking jungler): crash wave 5/6**
- Crash → **ward** / **reset** / **roam**.
- If you crash without a plan, you’re just giving Yone a free reset.

---

## The 3 timers you must track (this wins the matchup)

### 1) Yone Q stacks (Q3)
When he has Q3 ready, he has **CC + gapclose**.
- Play **slightly off-angle** (don’t let him Q3 straight through minions to you).
- If he spends Q3 on wave, you get **8–12 seconds** (roughly) where his threat is lower.

### 2) Yone E (Soul Unbound)
E is his “I win trade if you stand still” button.
- If he uses **E to farm** or “fake trade,” you can look for a **real trade** right after.
- If he uses E aggressively and you **survive**, he often snaps back with **no E**, which is your best all-in window later.

### 3) Level 6 (his R)
The lane becomes “one knock-up = death” if you’re low HP.
- Don’t sit at 60% HP and think you’re fine.
- Your job is to be **healthy** so you can survive the first commit and then punish.

---

## Trading: what to do (and what to never do)

### Your best trades (repeatable)
**Trade A: Q poke trade (no commit)**
- Q him when he last-hits → back up.
- You’re aiming for: chip + heal + deny him clean E setup.

**Trade B: punish-after-miss**
When he **misses Q3** or uses it on wave:
- Step up → **Q + autos** → disengage before he can re-stack.

### What you should NOT do
- **Don’t E forward** to start a trade unless his Q3 is down and you know where junglers are.
- **Don’t fight inside his W shield window.** If you see the shield, back up and re-hit after it fades.
- **Don’t take extended DPS trades during his E.** He’s built for that; you aren’t.

---

## How to use W correctly vs Yone (this is the skill check)

**Hold W for ONE of these:**
1. **Dodge Q3 knock-up** (most common)
2. **Dodge R knock-up** (highest value)
3. Deny lethal targeting when multiple enemies collapse

**Practical cueing:**
- If you can see him **posturing with Q3** (wind effect), your hand should be on W.
- If he’s walking in a straight line trying to line up **R**, do not panic-E; **W the moment he commits**.

**If you W early:** he can simply wait it out, then Q3/R you when it ends.

---

## Level 6+: when you can actually kill Yone

### “Real kill” windows
You want at least one of these:
- **He used E** and didn’t get value (or it’s on cooldown).
- **He used Q3** and missed / used it on wave.
- **He used W** for shield on wave (no shield for the fight).
- He’s **past river** with no vision and you’re healthy.

### Your all-in concept
Naafiri wins by committing **after** his key threat is spent.

**Simple all-in idea:**
- Bait/force **Q3** (sidestep with E or spacing)  
- **W** to avoid the follow-up CC (or to dodge R)  
- **R** commit when he’s exposed  
- Finish with Q “pop” timing and pack damage

If he still has **E + Q3 + R** available, your R is often a suicide button unless you’re massively ahead.

---

## Warding & jungle interaction (easy, repeatable)

### Default ward timing
- **2:45–3:15:** ward one side (raptor entrance / river brush), based on where you think the enemy jungler started.

### If you’re freezing near your tower (Plan A)
- Ward **your weak side** and ping your jungler: Yone is forced to walk up.
- If Yone burns **E** and your jungler is near, ping instantly — his movement is predictable and he often over-commits.

### If you’re crashing (Plan B)
- Crash → **ward deeper** (raptors / pixel brush) → reset or roam.  
Don’t linger mid in the open while his wave is under tower.

---

## Itemization vs Yone (what actually matters)

Yone is a **shield + sustain + DPS** champion. Build to:
- burst through short windows
- not instantly die to his all-in

### First buys
- **Serrated Dirk** (pressure)
- **Boots** if you need spacing
- **Early Cloth Armor / Plated Steelcaps** if you’re behind (it’s okay to “buy time”)

### High-value tech choices
- **Serpent’s Fang**: great value if Yone’s shield (W) is consistently saving him, or he’s stacking shield items.
- **Anti-heal**: consider if he’s healing too much to finish reliably (especially mid game).

*(Exact “best-in-slot” items change patch to patch; the principle is consistent: burst + survivability vs all-in.)*

---

## Mid game plan (where Naafiri should out-carry)

### Don’t handshake the side lane forever
Yone loves long side lanes. If you’re not clearly ahead, don’t perma-1v1 him.

Instead:
1. **Push mid / a side wave**
2. **Disappear into fog**
3. **Pick the support/ADC rotating**
4. Convert to **dragon / tower / vision**

### Objective setups
Naafiri is strongest when someone face-checks.
- Be in river/jungle **45–60s before** objectives
- Control ward a choke
- Let Yone show on a wave while you threaten the rotation kill

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** using W for speed, then dying to Q3/R  
  **Fix:** W is your **anti-knock-up button** first.

- **Mistake:** E-forward trades at level 3–6  
  **Fix:** hold E to **sidestep Q3** and keep your exit.

- **Mistake:** fighting while he has shield + E available  
  **Fix:** short trades; commit only when one key tool is down.

- **Mistake:** never crashing waves, never roaming  
  **Fix:** when you do get a crash, always **ward / roam / reset** — don’t idle.

---

## Quick decision checklist (use mid-fight)

Before you commit R, ask:
- Does he have **Q3** ready?
- Is **E** up?
- Is **R** up?
- Is my **W** available to dodge knock-up?
- Is the wave state safe (crashed/neutral), or am I about to lose 2 waves?

If 2+ answers are “bad,” don’t flip it — crash and play tempo.

---

## One-page lane script summary

**1–2:** last-hit, stay high HP, Q poke only  
**3:** respect E; never E forward; hold W for Q3/R  
**4–5:** freeze near tower unless you can crash with intention  
**6+:** healthy lane > ego; punish after he spends Q3/E; roam off crashes  
**Mid game:** fog picks + objective setups, not endless side-lane duels

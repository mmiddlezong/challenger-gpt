# Naafiri Mid vs Vel'Koz — Matchup Guide (Tempo Assassin Plan)

## Spell threat card (read this first)

### Vel'Koz (what can stop/kill you)
- **Q — Plasma Fission:** long-range skillshot that **slows**. If you get hit, it becomes much easier for him to land E and stack his passive.
- **W — Void Rift:** line poke/waveclear. No CC, but it chunks you and helps him keep you under tower.
- **E — Tectonic Disruption:** ground skillshot that **knocks up**. **This is the spell you must play around.** If it hits, your all-in usually dies.
- **R — Life Form Disintegration Ray:** long channel laser. No CC, but **massive DPS**. If you commit while it’s up, you need an exit plan (E/terrain) or a fast kill.

### Naafiri (your answers)
- **Q — Darkin Daggers:** safe last-hit + poke + **healing** when you tag him. Your “stay healthy” button.
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** **1s untargetable** + short steroid. Your **anti-CC timing tool** (hold it to dodge Vel’Koz E or a key Q).
- **E — Eviscerate:** short dash + AoE. Use it to **sidestep** skillshots and to reposition after you commit.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** champion-only targeted commit. Use it when Vel is **out of position** or after he **wastes E**.

## Your win condition in this matchup

Vel’Koz wants: **push → poke → keep you at 50% HP → win mid control → delete your team in 5v5.**

You want: **stable early lane → one clean crash window → reset/roam → come back with tempo → punish his E cooldown or rotations → convert to plates/tower/objectives → win via picks from fog.**

This matchup is rarely “solo kill him level 2.” It’s about **not bleeding HP**, then **using tempo to play the map**.

---

## Setup (simple, consistent defaults)

### Starting item (pick one)
- **Safer / most consistent vs poke:** *Doran’s Shield* (and don’t be ashamed of it).
- **Greedier snowball option:** *Long Sword + Refillable* (only if you reliably dodge Q/E).

### Early lane goal
- Hit level 3 with **high HP**.
- Avoid giving him **free passive stacks** (don’t eat repeated Q/W hits for a single CS).
- Avoid getting your wave stuck in a spot where you must walk up with no cooldowns.

---

## Lane plan by phases

## Levels 1–3: “Don’t lose HP for no reason”
**Your #1 resource is HP.** If you’re healthy, Vel has to respect level 6 later. If you’re at 40%, he can perma-zone you.

**Wave 1 (first 6 melee minions)**
- Last-hit only. Do **not** autopush into an artillery mage.
- Stand **slightly off to the side** of your minion wave (so his Q line can’t hit you *and* the minions).

**Wave 2**
- Keep it calm. Your job is to avoid getting chunked, not to “win wave 2.”
- Use **Q** to last hit and occasionally tag Vel **only when it’s safe** (short poke + heal = lane stability).

**Wave 3 (cannon wave)**
- Ideally you’re letting the wave drift toward you so you can farm safely.
- If he’s spamming W to shove, don’t panic—take the CS you can, keep HP high, and prepare for a **bounce** later.

**Key rule:** don’t E forward just to hit him. If you dash for damage, you often lose the only tool that dodges E/Q.

---

## Levels 3–5: “Create a crash → earn a choice”
Your first real “assassin tempo” moment is your **first clean crash**.

**How you get it vs Vel’Koz**
- Thin the wave with Q while staying healthy.
- When his wave is smaller and your next wave is arriving, you can build a slow push and then crash.

**After you crash, you MUST choose one:**
1. **Reset** (most consistent): buy, refill, come back with HP + tempo.
2. **Ward** (if you expect to be ganked when you try to crash next time).
3. **Roam with your jungler** (best if bot/top is gankable and the roam is quick).
4. **One safe plate** (only if you know the enemy jungler can’t punish you).

> The fastest way to lose this matchup is to crash a wave and then stand mid doing nothing while Vel resets the lane and keeps poking.

---

## Level 6 spike: “Punish positioning errors (but be disciplined)”
Once you have R, Vel is not “allowed” to walk past river without help. But you still need a real window.

### A REAL kill window usually looks like one of these
- Vel **used E** (on wave or missed it).
- Vel is **past river**, and you know where the jungler is (or you have backup).
- Vel is already **chipped** (your Q poke landed, he’s not full HP).
- You have a **bounce/crash** so you won’t lose 2 waves for the attempt.

### What is NOT a real window
- “I’ll R him while E is up and hope he misses.”
- “I’ll all-in under his tower with no vision.”
- “I’ll commit while I’m already at 50% HP.”

Remember: R is champion-only commitment. You’re choosing the next 10 seconds of your life.

## Trading and all-in rules (matchup-specific)

## Your best lane trade: “Q poke + heal, no commit”
- Use Q to last hit and tag him when he steps up.
- If you can land the follow-up “pop,” great—but don’t chase it through minion damage + Vel poke.

**Goal:** keep yourself healthy while slowly creating **threat** so he can’t freely walk up.

---

## The key spell bait: “Make him press E”
Vel’Koz is safest as long as **E is available**. Your job is to make him spend it badly.

**Ways to bait E**
- Walk up just enough to look threatening, then back off.
- Step toward a last-hit window (especially cannon), then **sidestep**.
- Show a “fake angle” from the side of the wave (he’ll often panic E the moment you look like you might engage).

Once E is down, you gain a short window to:
- take a better trade,
- shove and crash for tempo,
- or set up an all-in / jungler play.

---

## When you all-in: “Hold W for E”
**Your default discipline vs Vel:**
- **Do NOT W for movespeed early.**
- **Hold W to dodge E (knockup).** If you W at the wrong time, you’re just donating your life.

A consistent pattern:
1. Chip him with Q first (or wait for him to misposition).
2. **Wait for E to be used or clearly missed.**
3. **W** as you commit (use the untargetable window to deny his panic response).
4. **R** onto him when the path is clean.
5. Use **E** to either:
   - dodge the follow-up Q angle / reposition out of his R line, or
   - stick for the finishing damage.

If he starts **R** while you’re mid-commit:
- You either **kill fast**, or
- **exit the beam** with E/terrain and reset the fight.
Do not stand in it trying to “out-stat” an artillery ultimate.

## Wave + roam strategy (how you actually win)

Vel’Koz hates leaving lane and hates walking into fog. Use that.

### Your best “carry loop” vs Vel
1. Stabilize lane with Q sustain.
2. Build a wave that lets you **crash**.
3. After crash: **reset or roam** (don’t idle).
4. Hit 6 and threaten kills on positioning errors.
5. Leave mid, play fog/river, and create picks around objectives.
6. Convert picks into **plates → mid tower → dragons/herald/baron**.

### Roam rule (consistency > highlights)
Roam only when:
- you **crashed** (or are about to crash),
- the roam decision point is quick,
- and there’s actual setup (ally CC, enemy pushed, flash down).

If the roam is a guess, **reset instead**. Good recalls win games.

---

## Warding (simple, practical timings)
You’re most punishable when you finally try to crash and step up.

- **If you’re being shoved in:** ward on the first crash opportunity you get (after you clear a wave safely).
- **If you’re the one pushing to crash:** drop vision **before** you walk up for the crash, not after.

Good ward themes:
- river pixel brush (covers standard ganks),
- raptor entrance / jungle doorway (covers wraparounds),
- control ward on one side so you can lean there and dodge skillshots with more room.

---

## Mid game plan (where Naafiri carries vs Vel’Koz)

## Stop living mid permanently
Vel’Koz scales into terrifying 5v5 beams. Don’t give him clean, stationary teamfights.

Your pattern:
- catch mid wave,
- push it,
- disappear into fog (river/jungle),
- threaten a pick,
- if nothing happens, reset or re-show safely.

## Objective setups are your playground
45–60 seconds before dragon/herald/baron:
1. push mid first,
2. go dark,
3. sit in fog with a control ward.

**The carry play:** someone face-checks for vision → you delete them → free objective.

Vel’Koz players hate checking fog. Make them do it.

---

## Teamfights (how to not suicide)

### Your role: flank + cleanup
You are not the front line. If you R first into a grouped team, Vel will E + R you and you’ll explode.

### Entry rules vs Vel specifically
- Approach from the side.
- Identify **E** (knockup) as the “spell that stops you.”
- **Hold W** for the moment he throws E at you.
- Commit when:
  - Vel steps too far,
  - or his frontline peels away,
  - or someone else draws his E/attention.

### Target priority vs Vel comps
1. ADC / fed marksman
2. Vel’Koz (if exposed or if you have a clean angle)
3. enchanter support (if they prevent the kill)
4. isolated mage/secondary carry
5. tanks last

If Vel is protected and you can’t reach him safely, you can still carry by deleting **whoever is walking into fog late**.

## Common mistakes in this matchup (and fixes)

### Mistake: Taking free poke for CS
**Fix:** trade CS for HP early. You win later by tempo + picks, not by perfect lane stats.

### Mistake: Using W for movespeed and eating E
**Fix:** W is your anti-CC timing tool first. If you waste it, Vel’s E becomes lethal.

### Mistake: R’ing while Vel E is up and you’re low HP
**Fix:** don’t “prove you can kill him.” Crash → reset → roam → come back stronger.

### Mistake: Playing the mid game as 5v5 front-to-back
**Fix:** push → disappear → threaten picks. Vel is strongest when everyone lines up.

## Quick checklist (use every crash)
After you crash a wave, ask:
1. Where is the enemy jungler likely?
2. Is there a **70%+ roam** right now (setup + wave + vision)?
3. If not, can I ward/invade **with my jungler**?
4. If none of the above: **reset**.

---

## 5-game practice plan (to learn this matchup fast)
1. **HP discipline:** reach level 3 with high HP every game.
2. **W discipline:** in every fight, hold W specifically for Vel’Koz **E**.
3. **Crash-and-choose:** after every crash, do **one** of: ward / roam / reset.
4. **No idle mid:** catch → push → disappear (fog pressure).
5. **Post-kill conversion:** plates, mid tower, dragon/herald—make every win permanent.

---

## The one-sentence matchup summary
**Survive the poke, bait/deny E with W, create tempo through crashes, then win the map by fog-based picks and objective setups.**

# Naafiri Mid vs Galio — Matchup Guide (Assassin Macro + Lane Plan)

## Spell quick-read (what to respect / avoid)

**Galio Passive — Colossal Smash**
- After casting a spell, his next auto does a big magic-damage slam in an area.
- **What to avoid:** taking “free” passive autos after he Q’s the wave or whiffs a trade. Don’t stand in melee range when his passive is up.

**Galio Q — Winds of War**
- Two wind blasts converge and create a tornado zone that keeps damaging.
- **What to avoid:** standing in the tornado for multiple ticks; don’t tank Q + tornado while trying to last-hit.

**Galio W — Shield of Durand (MAIN THREAT)**
- He channels, gets **damage reduction**, then releases an AoE **TAUNT** (duration scales with channel time).
- **CC:** **Taunt** (your character walks into him, you lose control).
- **What to avoid:** committing your full burst **into his W channel**. If you all-in while he’s charging, your damage gets reduced and you risk getting taunted mid-combo.

**Galio E — Justice Punch (SETUP THREAT)**
- Step back then dash forward; on hit it **KNOCKS UP** and sets up W taunt.
- **CC:** **Knock-up**.
- **What to avoid:** standing in a straight line at E range when he has E available. If E hits, you often lose the entire trade (and sometimes your Flash).

**Galio R — Hero’s Entrance (MAP THREAT)**
- Long-range ally-targeted entrance that lands with a big AoE **KNOCK-UP**.
- **CC:** **Knock-up** on landing.
- **What to avoid:** slow/telegraphed roams and extended skirmishes after level 6. Galio’s ult turns your 2v2 into a losing 2v3 fast.

**Your key Naafiri tools vs Galio**
- **W (The Call of the Pack) = 1s untargetable on cast**: your best timing tool to dodge Galio E/W release or to “skip” a critical CC moment.
- You generally don’t “out-burst” Galio; you win by **tempo, wave control, and map conversions**.

## Matchup Summary (how this lane usually plays)

**Difficulty:** Medium–Hard (Galio is designed to punish assassins with CC + damage reduction).  
**Lane kill pressure:** Low unless Galio misplays cooldowns or you have jungler help.  
**Your win condition:**  
1) Don’t give Galio free all-in windows (E → W).  
2) Crash waves cleanly → roam with high-quality timers.  
3) Convert plays into plates/towers while Galio is stuck reacting.

**Galio’s win condition:**  
- Neutralize you mid, then use R to win every side-lane fight and objective skirmish.

---

## The core idea: “Dodge the CC, don’t fight the shield”

In this matchup you carry by **not dying** and by **being first to the fight**.

- Galio’s kit punishes **predictable, linear commits**.
- Your kit punishes **squishies** and **rotations**.
- So your goal is to **create mid pressure** without giving him the E→W starter, then take your threat elsewhere.

---

## Lane Plan by Game Phase

### Levels 1–2 (stability first)
**Primary goal:** arrive at level 3 with good HP and a manageable wave.

- Farm cleanly. Don’t take Q + tornado ticks just to last-hit one melee minion.
- Respect passive: if he casts Q on wave, he often wants to walk up and slam you once.
  - Give space, let the passive time out, then walk up again.

**What you’re looking for:** small Q pokes that also keep you healthy, not extended fights.

---

### Levels 3–5 (spacing + wave control)
**Primary goal:** avoid his E engage and make your first “crash-and-choice” happen on your terms.

**Wave posture options:**
- **If you’re worried about ganks / Galio engage:** keep the wave slightly closer to your side (thin the wave, don’t hard shove).
- **If you want to roam:** slow push 2 waves → crash the 3rd wave into his tower → move (ward/roam/reset).

**Key spacing rule:**  
If Galio has E up, don’t stand where he can E you *and* immediately W-taunt you under his minions.

**Trade rule:** short + clean.
- If he uses **W**, back up and don’t donate damage into reduction. Re-engage *after* the taunt threat ends.
- If he **misses E**, that’s your best lane window to poke/chunk (but still don’t over-commit into W).

---

### Level 6+ (roam quality vs Galio R)
Once Galio has R, your roams must be **fast and decisive**.

**Your roaming rules vs Galio:**
1) **Roam only on a crash or bounce.** Never leave a slow-pushing wave to Galio; he’ll shove and ult faster than you can fix mid.
2) **Don’t linger in river.** If you’re roaming, commit to the play within ~10–15 seconds.
3) **Ping his R cooldown and track his position.** If he disappears from mid with R up, assume he’s looking to ult a fight.

**If Galio ults to a fight:**
- Your default punish is **mid plates / mid tower damage**.
- If you can’t safely hit tower, take his raptors/vision and reset.

---

## Trading & Micro Rules (the “if X then Y” rules)

### Rule 1: Never full commit while his W is charging
- If you see W channel: **stop hitting him**, step out of range, and be ready to dodge the taunt release.
- After W ends, he’s much more vulnerable for the next 10–18 seconds.

### Rule 2: Treat Galio E as the lane’s “red button”
If E hits you:
- Expect W taunt next.
- Your priority becomes **survive and reset spacing**, not “win the trade”.
- Use your movement and defensive timing to avoid being chained into tower/jungle follow-up.

If E misses:
- You get a real window to poke/chunk or to force him off the wave.

### Rule 3: Use your W untargetable for ONE key moment
Don’t press W “for speed” unless you’re safe.
- **Best uses vs Galio:**
  - dodge the E collision moment (or force him to whiff)
  - dodge the instant the W-taunt releases
  - deny a crucial CC chain during a gank/skirmish

**Practice goal:** one successful “W dodge” per game is huge.

### Rule 4: Do not take extended melee trades
Galio wins long trades through:
- passive slams
- W damage reduction + taunt
- Q tornado zoning

You want: **burst windows**, not brawls.

## Wave Management Blueprint (what “good” looks like)

### Your default wave plan
- **Neutral or slightly toward you** early.
- **Crash when you want a play** (roam/ward/reset).
- **Don’t perma-shove** without vision: Galio + jungler CC is lethal.

### Crash-and-choice checklist (every time you crash a wave)
After you crash, pick **one**:
1) Ward deep (raptors / river)  
2) Roam with your jungler  
3) Quick side-lane look (10–15 seconds max)  
4) Reset (best for consistency)

If you can’t name a choice, **reset**.

---

## Jungle Interaction (how to win the lane without solo-killing)

**Naafiri + jungler** is how Galio actually dies.
- Galio is tanky, but he’s not slippery. If his E is down and he’s extended, ganks can work.
- Your job is to create a wave state that makes him step up:
  - freeze near your tower so he walks forward to farm
  - or slow push and crash to set up a dive only if you have reliable CC from jungle/support

**Important:** if you bait Galio W early in a gank, the gank succeeds more often.

---

## Roaming & Macro (how you carry this matchup)

### Your best roam windows vs Galio
- After a clean crash when Galio has to last-hit under tower.
- When your jungler is already moving and you can create a fast 2v1 or 2v2.

### Your worst roams vs Galio
- slow roams where you hang around river
- roams where the enemy lane is not extended
- roams after level 6 when your play takes too long (Galio R will beat you)

### When you should *stay mid*
- Your side lanes are not gankable (reset wave, full HP, safe positioning)
- Dragon/Herald is spawning soon and you need to keep mid priority
- Galio is missing with R up and you can’t see the setup—don’t walk into fog

---

## Mid/Late Teamfights (how to not get peeled into uselessness)

Galio’s job in fights is to **stand on carries and taunt you**.

**Your job:**
- Don’t enter through the front.
- Flank from fog and force a target who is **not protected by Galio W zone**.

**Fight rules:**
- If Galio is holding W, he’s holding it for you. Don’t give him a clean taunt.
- Let your team start or let key CC be used, then go.
- If you can’t reach the backline safely, you can still carry by:
  - deleting a squishy support/jungler on a rotation
  - catching side waves and threatening picks in fog
  - forcing Galio to show, then hitting objectives elsewhere

## Common Mistakes (and the fix)

**Mistake:** “I can kill Galio if I just full combo him.”  
**Fix:** Assume you *can’t* unless he misuses W/E or you have help. Play for tempo and map.

**Mistake:** Bursting into W channel and getting taunted mid-combo.  
**Fix:** Back off when W starts, re-engage after.

**Mistake:** Roaming after level 6 without considering Galio R.  
**Fix:** Roams must be quick or you convert mid plates when he ults.

**Mistake:** Perma-shoving with no vision.  
**Fix:** Shove only when you have a plan and wards; otherwise hold a safer wave.

---

## Learning Objectives (focus games on these)

### Objective A — “Zero deaths to E → W”
**Target:** In your next 5 games vs Galio, die **0 times** to the direct E→W chain in lane.  
**How:** track E cooldown; stand outside his engage line; don’t greed melees.

### Objective B — “One clean crash-and-choice per 2 waves”
**Target:** Every time you crash a wave, you immediately choose ward/roam/reset.  
**Measure:** review replay: did you stand mid doing nothing after a crash?

### Objective C — “One W dodge per game”
**Target:** Use Naafiri W untargetable to dodge **either**:
- Galio E collision
- Galio W taunt release  
Even one successful dodge swings the matchup.

### Objective D — “Punish Galio R with guaranteed gold”
**Target:** Whenever Galio ults away, you get **something permanent**:
- 1–2 plates, or
- mid tower damage, or
- deep vision + enemy jungle camps.

## Quick Reference: The 10-second Game Plan

**In lane:**  
- Farm → don’t eat tornado ticks → don’t get E’d → don’t hit into W.

**On crash:**  
- Ward / roam / reset (no indecision).

**After 6:**  
- Roam fast or punish mid when he ults.

**In fights:**  
- Flank, don’t front-enter into W taunt.

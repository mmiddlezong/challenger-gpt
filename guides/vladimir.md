# Naafiri Mid vs Vladimir — Matchup Guide

## Vladimir spells (what to respect)
- **Q – Transfusion:** Point-and-click damage + heal. Every few casts he gets an **empowered Q** (big damage/heal + movespeed).  
  **Avoid:** trading into empowered Q unless you’re finishing a kill.
- **W – Sanguine Pool:** Vladimir becomes **untargetable** and sinks into a pool, damaging and **slowing** enemies on it.  
  **This is the #1 spell you must bait before committing.**
- **E – Tides of Blood:** Charged AoE damage (bigger when charged).  
  **Avoid:** standing in it for free while he’s charging; don’t take repeated E poke while slow-pushing.
- **R – Hemoplague:** Debuff on you (and nearby allies) that increases damage taken, then explodes.  
  **Avoid:** long fights while marked; don’t commit if you’ll be forced to stay in after R.

**CC warning:** Vladimir has **no hard CC**, but his **W slow** makes jungler ganks and extended fights dangerous.

## Matchup identity (who wants what)
### Vladimir’s win condition
- **Survive lane → scale into mid/late fights** with huge sustain and AoE threat.
- Use **Q sustain** to neutralize poke and **W** to deny your all-in.
- After level 6, he can **turn fights** with R + burst + healing.

### Naafiri’s win condition
- **Punish his early weakness**, then **convert tempo into map impact** (plates, roams, objectives).
- Force him to **use W defensively**, then kill during the window it’s down.
- If you can’t kill him reliably, **don’t tunnel lane**: shove, roam, and snowball sides.

---

## The two resources you must track (always)
1. **Vlad empowered Q timer (Crimson Rush):**  
   If it’s up, he can “win” trades by healing back and chunking you.
2. **Vlad W cooldown:**  
   If W is up, your full commit is often **wasted**. If W is down, he’s extremely punishable.

---

## Lane plan by game phase

### Levels 1–2: establish control without bleeding HP
**Goal:** build a small CS lead and keep your health high.
- Use **Q to last-hit + tag him** when he walks up.
- Don’t take repeated Qs from him for no reason—his sustain is better than yours in pure “poke wars.”
- Avoid letting the wave perma-push if you’re not warded (Vlad has no CC, but enemy jungler does).

**Good sign:** you’re even or up in CS and still healthy.

---

### Levels 3–5: set up a freeze to force him forward
This is your best lane window.

**Preferred wave state:** a **freeze or slow push toward you**.
- If you hold the wave on your side, Vladimir must step up to Q/last-hit.
- That creates **real punish windows** because he can’t just farm under tower safely.

**Trading rule:** short trades that threaten his W.
- Hit him with **Q** when he walks up.
- If he **pools**, disengage immediately. Don’t chase into the pool.
- Once W is used, you have a window to play aggressively (but still respect jungler).

**Your mindset:** “I’m not trying to kill him through W. I’m trying to *make him press W*, then kill him after.”

---

### Level 6+: respect his turn potential, punish W cooldown
After 6, he gains real kill threat if you overcommit.

**When you should NOT R him**
- He has **W available** and you can’t force it first.
- You’re low enough that **R + E + empowered Q** could swing the fight.
- You don’t know where the enemy jungler is.

**When you CAN look for all-ins**
- He has **no W** (best case).
- His **empowered Q is not ready**, or he’s low enough that he can’t outheal the burst.
- Wave is in a state where you won’t lose 2 waves + plates if it fails.

---

## Trading patterns (what actually works)

### Pattern A: “poke → threaten → bait pool”
1. Q him when he last-hits.
2. Walk up like you might commit (without burning everything).
3. If he pools, **back off** and keep the wave in your favor.

**Win condition of the trade:** he pressed W and you didn’t lose much HP.

---

### Pattern B: “commit only after W is down”
- Once W is down, you can take **longer trades** because he can’t become untargetable.
- If he tries to “stall” with empowered Q healing, you must either:
  - finish fast, or
  - disengage and repeat after the next wave.

---

### Pattern C: “W as a dodge tool (advanced)”
Your W (untargetable) can occasionally deny targeted damage if timed perfectly, but don’t rely on it as your main answer:
- Treat it primarily as **commit + outplay window** in skirmishes.
- In lane, your most consistent defense is **wave state + spacing**, not “out-timing” every Vlad cast.

---

## All-in checklist (before you press R)
Only go if you can say “yes” to most of these:
- **Is Vladimir’s W down?** (or can I force it first?)
- **Is his empowered Q NOT ready**, or is he already low?
- **Is the wave safe** (crashed / neutral / toward me)?
- **Do I know where the enemy jungler is?**
- **Do I have an exit plan** if he survives (E angle, back through minions, toward vision)?

If you can’t answer these, **don’t flip it**—use your wave to roam instead.

---

## Wave management rules (how you actually win the matchup consistently)

### Rule 1: Freezing is stronger than perma-shoving
Perma-shoving gives Vladimir what he wants:
- safe farm under tower
- time to scale
- less room to punish him

Instead:
- **Thin the wave** and hold it on your side.
- Make him walk up into your threat range.

### Rule 2: Crash only when you have a plan
Crash wave when you will:
- roam
- reset
- ward/deep vision with your jungler
- take a safe plate

Otherwise, freezing and denying him comfort is better.

### Rule 3: Don’t slow-push while taking free E damage
If you’re building a slow push and he’s charging E repeatedly, you’re paying HP to deliver him a wave.
Either:
- thin the wave and reset it,
- or hard crash and reset.

---

## Roaming vs staying in lane (the key decision)
If Vladimir is playing perfectly (safe, holding W, sustaining), **you can still win the game** by not making lane your whole world.

### Good roam timings
- After you **crash a big wave** and he must last-hit under tower.
- When he has **no W** and is forced to play back (you can move first).
- When your jungler wants to fight for river/raptors and you can push first.

### Bad roam timings
- When your wave is slow-pushing away (you’ll lose multiple waves).
- When you’re low HP and would lose a 2v2.
- When bot/top has no setup and you’re just guessing.

**Mental model:** if you can’t reliably solo-kill him, your “carry path” becomes **tempo + side kills + objectives**.

---

## Playing with junglers (how to actually get kills on Vlad)
Vladimir is awkward to gank because of W, but he is also **very punishable when W is forced**.

### Your best setup for ganks
- Hold a **freeze near your tower**.
- Trade lightly to lower him.
- The moment he pools (even for a small trade), **ping your jungler**: “W down” and look for a gank in the next ~20–30 seconds.

### What NOT to do
- Don’t hard shove and ask for ganks under his tower—he’ll pool and walk away.
- Don’t R first into his W hoping your jungler fixes it.

---

## Mid game plan (after first tower / plates)
### Your ideal game
- Mid tower down (or you’re pressuring it)
- You rotate to a side lane
- You kill squishies and catch rotations
- Vladimir is forced to respond to waves instead of free-scaling mid

### What to avoid
- ARAM 5v5 where Vladimir gets to hit multiple people with R and sustain forever.
- Front-to-back fights where you can’t access carries.

### What to do instead
- Push a side wave, then disappear into fog.
- Look for picks on:
  - enemy ADC/support rotating
  - jungler face-checking
  - side laners catching alone

---

## Teamfighting vs Vladimir (how to not lose late)
Vlad is terrifying when he:
- hits multiple people with R
- gets time to heal through the fight

### Your job
- **Don’t be the first one in.**
- Look for **flank picks** and delete a carry before Vlad gets a perfect fight.
- If he ults you, your priority becomes **exit + re-enter**, not “finish the hero play.”

### Priority targets
- ADC / immobile mage
- Enchanter (if they keep the carry alive)
- Vladimir is often **not** the best first target unless he’s isolated and W is down.

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

### Mistake: R into Vlad when W is up
**Fix:** force W with poke/threat first, then commit during cooldown.

### Mistake: trading into empowered Q repeatedly
**Fix:** back up when it’s ready; trade after it’s used.

### Mistake: perma-shoving and “letting him scale safely”
**Fix:** freeze/hold wave on your side; crash only with a plan.

### Mistake: trying to “out-sustain” him
**Fix:** win with **tempo**, not an endless poke war.

### Mistake: joining ARAM fights too early
**Fix:** side lane + fog picks; force him to respond.

---

## Learning objectives (focus games)
Pick ONE block for 5–10 games.

### Block 1 — “W tracking discipline”
**Objective:** Every time Vlad uses W, you:
- ping it (mentally or in chat)
- play aggressively for the next wave cycle  
**Win condition:** you create at least one meaningful punish window per game.

### Block 2 — “Wave control: freeze first”
**Objective:** Hold a freeze near your side for at least **2 full waves** before 10 minutes.  
**Win condition:** Vlad is forced to farm forward or lose CS.

### Block 3 — “No bad R”
**Objective:** Zero R casts onto Vlad while his W is up (unless he’s already committed and can’t pool).  
**Win condition:** you stop donating your ultimate to his defensive button.

### Block 4 — “Tempo roams”
**Objective:** 3 roams by 14 minutes, each after a crash/reset.  
**Win condition:** ≥2 roams produce summoners, kills, or objective pressure.

### Block 5 — “Fight entry discipline”
**Objective:** In mid/late fights, you enter **after** Vlad shows or after key cooldowns are used.  
**Win condition:** fewer “I went in and got drained” deaths.

## Quick in-game reminders (sticky notes)
- **Bait pool, then kill.**
- **Don’t trade into empowered Q.**
- **Freeze > shove** unless you’re roaming/resetting.
- If lane won’t break: **push, roam, snowball sides.**
- Late game: **flank picks**, avoid front-to-back into Vlad.

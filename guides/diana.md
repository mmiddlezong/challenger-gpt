# Naafiri Mid vs Diana — Matchup Guide

## quick spell threat card (read this first)

### diana — what you must respect
- **passive (moonsilver blade):** after she casts a spell she gets a big **attack speed** window, and every 3rd auto **cleaves**.  
  **what to avoid:** **extended trades** where she gets multiple passive procs.
- **q (crescent strike):** curved skillshot that **marks you with “moonlight.”**  
  **what to avoid:** getting tagged by Q for free — **Q hit = her E becomes “free”** and she can stick to you.
- **w (pale cascade):** shield + 3 orbs that deal damage; if all orbs hit, she gets an **extra shield**.  
  **what to avoid:** dumping your whole combo into her **fresh W shield**.
- **e (lunar rush):** targeted dash. If you’re marked by **moonlight**, she effectively gets **reset/no cooldown** on the dash.  
  **what to avoid:** fighting in a straight line after Q hits; she’ll chase.
- **r (moonfall):** short-range AOE that **reveals, pulls enemies toward her, and slows**; then after a short delay it **slams for big AOE damage**.  
  **CC to respect:** the **pull (displacement)** + **slow**.  
  **what to avoid:** standing close to her (or clumped with teammates) when she has R.

### your naafiri buttons that matter vs diana
- **W (call of the pack):** **1 second untargetable** + AD/MS steroid + refreshes/recalls pack.  
  **your #1 defensive tool**: you can use it to *dodge the important moment* (often Diana R pull, or her committed all-in).
- **Q:** your lane sustain + “short trade” damage (bleed + pop).  
- **E:** your reposition (finish trades, dodge, or create space).  
- **R:** champion-only commit tool. vs Diana you want **high certainty** commits (after she misses Q, wastes E, or you have jungler help).

---

## matchup in one sentence
**Diana wants Q → stick to you → long fight → level 6 clump-R kill.**  
**You want to dodge Q, take short trades, and win through tempo (crash → roam/reset) + punishing her cooldown windows.**

---

## win conditions (how you consistently win this matchup)

### you win when:
- you **dodge most Qs** in lane (or at least don’t let her Q-for-free repeatedly)
- you keep trades **short** and don’t let her farm passive procs on you
- you don’t “donate” kills at level 6 to Q→E→R
- you use wave control to **deny her roams** and/or create your own roams
- in mid game you **don’t group in a tight ball** and you fight from angles, not front-to-back

### you lose when:
- you get hit by Q repeatedly and let her choose every trade
- you take extended trades into W shield + passive
- you blow W aggressively, then she ults you the next time you’re in range
- you ARAM mid and give her easy multi-person Moonfall setups

---

## lane plan (by level)

### levels 1–2: “don’t take the bait”
**goal:** arrive to level 3 with decent HP and a wave state you can play from.

- assume she’s looking for **Q poke** and short engages.
- your job is to **farm cleanly** and keep enough HP that you can contest the lane later.

**micro rule:**  
If she’s posturing to Q you while you last-hit, *choose one*:  
- take the CS and sidestep immediately  
- or give the CS if it would cost too much HP  
(being 40% HP at level 3 is worse than being down 2 CS)

### levels 3–5: “trade only on your terms”
**goal:** only trade when (a) her Q misses, or (b) her W is down/ending, or (c) you have jungler advantage.

Your default pattern:
- **Q poke/trade → back off**
- hold **E** to dodge/space, not to start every trade
- hold **W** for the moment she commits (or for a gank/escape)

### level 6+: “respect the 100–0 window”
Once Diana has R, her best kill is:
- hit Q → E in → W shield → R pull/slam while you’re stuck in range

Your job:
- **never be in her E+R range at low HP**
- if Q hits and you’re not winning the all-in, **instantly back off** (even if it means dropping a few minions)

---

## the trading rules (simple if/then system)

### 1) if diana Q hits you…
- **do not “try to win anyway”** unless she’s already chunked / you have jungler help.
- back up so she can’t get a clean E→W→passive chain.
- if she dashes in anyway, you have 2 realistic lines:
  - **defensive W** to deny her key damage moment and create space  
  - **E away** to break her stickiness and end the trade fast

**important:** don’t W instantly every time you’re tagged by Q. you want to save W for *the committed all-in* (often her R timing).

### 2) if diana Q misses…
This is your best lane window.
- step up for a **short Q trade**
- if she uses E anyway (no moonlight reset), she’s more punishable — **hit her, then disengage**
- do NOT turn it into a 6-second brawl; just win the health trade and reset spacing

### 3) if diana W is active…
- treat it like “she is temporarily hard to burst.”
- either:
  - take a **tiny** trade (Q hit) and back off, or
  - wait it out and trade after it expires

### 4) if diana uses E without moonlight reset…
That’s a “she’s stuck” window.
- kite backward through your minions
- short trade her (Q + pack damage)
- if your jungler is near, **ping immediately**: she has no clean way to disengage

### 5) if diana has R and you’re in range…
- don’t stand next to your wave + don’t stand next to your jungler in river
- keep a “bubble” around her
- if she goes for Moonfall:
  - **best case:** time **W** so you are untargetable through the **pull moment**  
  - **second best:** E out early so she only hits you, not you + wave + teammates

## wave management: how to make the lane playable

### default wave goal vs diana
**keep the wave slightly on your side** (a shallow freeze / slow push toward you).

Why:
- makes her Q angles more telegraphed
- makes her E commits riskier
- sets up your jungler to punish her if she oversteps

### when to push
Push only with a plan:
- crash a wave to **reset** (safe recall)
- crash a wave to **roam with your jungler**
- crash a wave to take a **plate** only if you have vision of enemy jungler

### the “anti-roam rule”
Diana loves leaving lane and hitting a multi-man R at dragon.
If you can keep the wave near you:
- she either roams and loses a wave
- or stays and you deny her playmaking

---

## jungle interaction (2v2 and ganks)

### your best gank setup
- wave is near your tower
- Diana uses Q to push
- she steps up for W/orbs or passive autos

Your job:
- **don’t start the fight too early**
- let her use E forward, then you punish the fact she can’t easily exit

### respecting enemy jungler
Diana + jungler is very lethal because she supplies:
- gapclose
- AOE slow/pull later
- strong sustained damage

So:
- if you don’t know where enemy jungler is, don’t take long trades in the middle of lane.

## mid game plan: how to win vs diana’s teamfight threat

### rule #1: don’t give her the “dream moonfall”
If you group as 5 mid and stand in a clump, you’re playing into her win condition.

In objective setups:
- **arrive early**
- spread out
- control vision so you don’t face-check into her

### what you want to do instead
- push a wave, disappear, and look for picks on rotations
- force fights when her R is down
- in 5v5s, approach from a flank so she can’t hit you + your backline at once

### target selection vs diana comps
Often you don’t kill Diana first if she’s bruiser-y and shielded.
Your best outcomes are:
- assassinate her carry while she’s looking for the big R
- or punish her after she commits (she has to go in to do damage)

---

## micro tips (small things that add up)

- **don’t “auto duel” her.** she is designed to win those with passive + shield.
- **track her Q animation** more than anything else. if you dodge Q, the lane becomes 10x easier.
- **space away from your own minion clump at level 6+.** getting pulled while stuck in minions is how you die.
- **don’t R into her W shield** unless it’s a guaranteed kill. you’ll just get outlasted.

---

## common mistakes (and fixes)

- **mistake:** “i got hit by Q but i can still win the trade”  
  **fix:** treat Q-hit like a stop sign unless she’s already low or you have numbers.
- **mistake:** using W to move faster for a random trade  
  **fix:** hold W for the committed all-in / Moonfall timing.
- **mistake:** fighting while her W is active  
  **fix:** trade after it ends, or only take a tiny Q tap.
- **mistake:** grouping tight at dragon  
  **fix:** spread, flank, and play fog-of-war.

## learning objectives (pick ONE per game block)

### block A (5 games): “dodge Q”
**goal:** in lane, don’t take more than **3 clean Q hits** before level 6.  
**review:** every time you got hit, was it while last-hitting? were you moving predictably?

### block B (5 games): “short trades only”
**goal:** every trade ends within **2 seconds** unless Diana is 20% HP and dying.  
**review:** count how many times she got 2+ passive procs on you in a single trade.

### block C (5 games): “W discipline”
**goal:** you only press W for:
- dodging/negating her all-in (especially R pull timing), or
- escaping a gank / enabling a guaranteed kill
**review:** did you ever die with W down because you used it earlier for nothing?

### block D (5 games): “wave on your side”
**goal:** keep the wave on your side for the first **6 minutes** (unless you’re crashing for a reset).  
**review:** if the wave is stuck on her side, how did it happen? (over-pushing? bad crash?)

### block E (5 games): “no clump deaths”
**goal:** after level 6, you never die to a Moonfall that also hits **2+ of your teammates**.  
**review:** were you standing on your support/jungler? did you walk into river as a group?

---

## quick VOD review questions (60 seconds after each game)
1. how many times did Diana Q hit you in lane “for free”?
2. did you ever fight into her W shield + passive window?
3. did you use W proactively and then get punished by her next all-in?
4. did you lose to her teamfight because you grouped/clumped at objectives?
5. what was your best punish moment after she missed Q or used E without reset?

---

## cheat sheet (if you only remember 3 things)
1. **dodge Q** (moonlight is her whole lane)  
2. **short trades only** (don’t auto-duel her)  
3. **save W for her commit** (often Moonfall timing)

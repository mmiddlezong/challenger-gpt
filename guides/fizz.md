# Naafiri vs Fizz (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first)

### Fizz (what you MUST respect)
- **R — Chum the Waters:** long-range skillshot fish. **If it tags a champion:** you’re **slowed**, then after a delay a shark erupts for big burst with **knock-up** + more slow.  
  **This is the main CC that gets you killed.** If you get hit while below ~70–80% HP, assume you’re in lethal range.
- **E — Playful / Trickster:** **untargetable hop** (his biggest outplay tool). Used to:
  - **Dodge your R/Q timing**
  - **Negate ganks**
  - **Burst you** (and the first landing applies a **slow**)
  This is the button you want to **bait out** before committing.
- **Q — Urchin Strike:** targeted dash through a unit. Enables him to **start trades** and stick to you.
- **W — Seastone Trident:** empowered autos + damage-over-time. Makes short trades hurt.
- **Passive — Nimble Fighter:** lets him move through units and reduces incoming damage (trades are slightly dampened).

### Naafiri (your tools vs Fizz)
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** **1 second untargetable.** Your #1 answer to:
  - **Dodging Fizz R** (make the fish miss)
  - **Dodging E landing damage/slow** in tight situations  
  **Rule:** when Fizz has R, you generally **hold W** to avoid it.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** your champion-only commit tool. **Do NOT press R into Fizz E** (he can go untargetable and waste your engage).
- **Q:** your safest win condition in lane: poke + sustain + wave shaping.
- **E:** dash + burst + reposition. Use it to:
  - dodge follow-up positioning after shark hits
  - finish after you’ve forced out Fizz E
  - reposition out of his Q-stickiness

## Matchup identity (what this lane is really about)
This is **cooldown chicken**:

- **Fizz wins** if he lands **R** or forces a messy all-in while your **W is down**.
- **You win** if you keep HP stable, control the wave, and **punish his E cooldown** with either:
  - a clean all-in
  - a jungle gank when E is down
  - or roams while he’s stuck catching waves

**Single most important rule:**  
> **Never commit your R until Fizz has used E OR you are 100% sure he cannot dodge it.**

---

## Lane plan by phases

### Levels 1–2 (before he has E)
**Your job:** get a health + wave advantage without taking a dumb Q trade.

- Poke with **Q** when he steps up for last hits.
- Respect that **Fizz Q is targeted**: if you stand too close, he can Q you and win a short trade with W autos.
- Try to build a *controlled* slow push (don’t mindlessly shove if you’re unwarded).

**Simple success pattern:**  
- Last-hit, tag him with Q when he goes for CS, keep your HP high.

### Levels 3–5 (E is online)
Fizz’s threat turns on because **E is both damage and untargetability**.

Use this mindset:
- **E up:** you *poke and farm*. Don’t hard-commit.
- **E down:** you *threaten kill/gank/roam*.

**How to bait E (reliable and safe):**
1. Walk up like you want to trade.
2. Throw Q1 / show aggression.
3. If he panics and E’s defensively, **don’t chase into it**. Just back up.
4. Once he lands and E is down, you have a real window.

### Level 6+ (shark lane)
When he has R, the lane becomes: “Can you avoid the fish?”

**Your priority list:**
1. **Stay above lethal HP thresholds** (don’t sit at 50% HP in lane).
2. **Hold W** for the fish unless you have perfect information and a guaranteed play.
3. If he misses R (or uses it elsewhere), you can play aggressive for the next minute.

**If you get hit by R:**
- Assume he’s committing. Don’t try to “out-trade.”
- If you have W, you can sometimes W to avoid the *follow-up damage timing* or deny him clean targeting for a moment.
- If you don’t have W, you likely need to disengage immediately (Flash if necessary) unless your jungler is already there to turn.

## Trading rules (make these habits)

### Rule 1: Don’t start trades inside his Q range when E is up
If you walk into his Q range while E is ready, he can:
- Q onto you
- force your dash/spacing
- then E to dodge your retaliation and still chunk you

Your default “safe damage” is **Q poke**, not melee autos.

### Rule 2: Your all-in window is **after** his E
**The matchup is designed so that** if you R while E is up, good Fizz players dodge it.

So your cleanest kill sequence is:
- **Bait E** → then **W (buff/untargetable if needed)** → **R commit** → finish with Q/E while he has no escape.

### Rule 3: If you spend W offensively, you must immediately respect shark
If you used W to win a trade and didn’t get a big advantage, you are vulnerable.
When Fizz has R:
- treat your W cooldown as “I can die now” time.

## Wave management (how you stop him from roaming)
Fizz wants to:
- clear the wave
- disappear into fog
- press R on your bot lane

Your tools to prevent this:
- **Crash waves cleanly** (so he must last-hit under tower)
- **Hold waves near your side** when you’re weaker (so he can’t roam without losing a full wave)

### Practical wave rules
- If you’re low HP or W is down: **let the wave come to you** (thin it with Q; don’t stand in the open).
- If you’re healthy and E is down: **push and threaten** (either a dive setup with jungler or a roam timer).
- If he uses E to clear the wave: that’s a green light to either:
  - take a trade
  - get vision
  - or roam (because he can’t match aggressively)

---

## Jungle interaction (how to actually get a lead)
Fizz is hard to gank **when E is up** and easy to punish **when E is down**.

### Call for ganks when:
- Wave is closer to your turret (long lane for him)
- Fizz used E recently
- You have health and can follow

### Avoid dying to ganks by:
- Not perma-pushing without vision (Fizz + jungler with shark is lethal)
- Tracking enemy jungler timing and warding on “crash” windows

---

## Mid game and roams (who gets to play the map)
Fizz’s best win condition is roaming with R. Your job is to make his roams expensive or late.

### If Fizz leaves lane
Use this decision tree:
1. **Can I arrive in time to turn the fight?**  
   - If yes: shove quickly *only if it won’t be too late*, then move.
2. **If no:** hard shove and take plates / mid tower damage, then drop vision in his jungle.

**Key principle:**  
Matching a roam late is how you lose twice (you lose the wave AND you don’t save your team).

### Your roaming advantage
If you keep wave control, you can roam on your own terms.
Your best roams are:
- with jungler into river vision/picks
- bot lane collapses when enemy is pushed
- catching Fizz on a recall timer (he hates being forced to catch waves)

---

## Teamfights (how you don’t get out-assassinated)
Fizz wants to flank and delete one carry with R. You have two viable approaches:

### Approach A: Race the backline (default when you’re ahead)
- Push a side wave
- enter from fog
- wait for him to show
- commit on their carry first

### Approach B: Counter-dive (when your ADC is the win condition)
- Hover near your carry just outside vision
- When Fizz commits and spends E, **you punish the exit** (R him after E is used, or kill his follow-up)

**Important:** don’t “stand mid and ARAM” into shark angles. Assassins win by fog and flanks.

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

### Mistake: R-ing before E
**Fix:** treat E as “spell shield.” Bait it, then commit.

### Mistake: Using W to farm/trade, then dying to shark
**Fix:** when Fizz has R, W is a defensive resource first.

### Mistake: Following Fizz into fog because you’re mad
**Fix:** shove, take plates, set vision. Make his roam cost him.

### Mistake: Trying to outplay while low HP
**Fix:** if you’re below lethal threshold, your job is to *reset the lane* (wave → recall) not to handshake fights.

---

## Focused learning objectives (use these to practice)

### Objective 1: “E tracking” (5–10 games)
**Goal:** every time Fizz uses E, say out loud: **“E down — I can play.”**  
**Success looks like:**
- you immediately trade, call gank, or take space
- you stop wasting R into E

### Objective 2: “Hold W for shark” (5–10 games)
**Goal:** when Fizz has R, you do not use W unless:
- you’re dodging R
- you have a guaranteed kill
- or you’re recalling immediately after

### Objective 3: “Roam discipline” (5–10 games)
**Goal:** you only roam on a **crash** or a **bounce**.  
Track: how many roams cost you more than 1 wave? Aim for **near zero**.

### Objective 4: “No deaths to predictable R” (ongoing)
After every death, ask:
- Was I low HP in lane with Fizz missing?
- Did I have W and fail to hold it?
- Did I stand in a straight line with no minion/spacing?

---

## One-page quick plan (copy/paste mental checklist)

- **Pre-3:** poke with Q, avoid standing in Q range for free.
- **Post-3:** E up = chill. E down = punish.
- **Post-6:** hold W for shark, keep HP high.
- **Never R into E.** Bait it first.
- If he roams: match early or punish with plates + vision — don’t arrive late.

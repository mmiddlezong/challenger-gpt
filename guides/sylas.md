# Naafiri Mid vs Sylas — Matchup Guide (Practical Rules)

## Your goal (what “winning” means)
- **0–1 deaths by 10 minutes**
- Don’t give Sylas the lane state he wants (long lane + repeated all-ins)
- Get to midgame where you can **pick squishies** and play **fog/objectives**
- Accept the reality: Sylas *wants* extended fights and out-sustain — you win by **short trades + tempo**, not by brawling.

---

## Why this matchup is hard (what you’re actually fighting)
Sylas punishes Naafiri in 3 ways:
1) **Extended trades:** his kit rewards staying in range and casting multiple rotations.
2) **Turn fights:** his W healing (especially when low) can flip “I almost killed him” into “I died.”
3) **CC + mobility:** if you commit in a straight line, his E follow-up can lock you and force a losing fight.

Also, once he has R, he can steal your ultimate — which means your “I’m safe because I’m an assassin” instincts can backfire if he has your engage tool available.

---

## Non‑negotiable rules (follow these and you stop bleeding deaths)
### Rule 1 — **Never take extended fights**
Your trades should look like:
- hit → back off → reset wave/spacing

If you stay for “one more auto,” you’re playing into his win condition.

### Rule 2 — **Keep the lane short (wave slightly toward you)**
Sylas is scary when he has space to chase.
A short lane means:
- he can’t run you down as easily
- your jungler has better angles
- you can disengage after short trades

Default: last hit early, avoid perma-shoving unless it’s crash → reset/roam.

### Rule 3 — **Respect his E window**
Sylas’s big threat is landing his E follow-up.
Your default behavior:
- keep minions between you and him whenever possible
- if he uses E and misses (or uses it badly), **that’s your “my turn” window**

### Rule 4 — **Your W is a defensive timer, not a “go button”**
In this matchup, wasting W for speed is how you die.
Hold W for:
- dodging the *moment* his engage/CC would connect
- denying his ability to stick to you in an all-in
- surviving ganks / 2v2s

### Rule 5 — **Don’t “almost kill” Sylas**
If you chunk him low and then keep fighting, you’re often giving him the perfect heal + turn.
Instead:
- chunk → back off → crash/deny → reset/roam
Make him spend his sustain without getting a kill.

## Lane plan (minutes 0–10)

### Levels 1–2: health first
- Don’t overtrade early just because he’s melee.
- Farm and poke only when it’s safe.
- Keep wave from hard pushing unless you have a clear crash plan.

**Win condition:** reach level 3 with enough HP that you can play wave properly.

### Levels 3–5: the matchup becomes “E landing = danger”
- If he is posturing aggressively, assume he wants to E you.
- Stand behind minions and keep space.
- Trade only in short bursts and disengage before he can chain abilities.

**Your best outcomes here are:**
- good HP
- wave closer to you
- forcing him to use spells on wave (mana/tempo cost)

### Level 6+: his R changes the map more than the 1v1
- He can steal your ult, so if you’re low or wave is long, he can threaten unexpected all-ins or roams.
- Don’t get baited into “I have R so I must fight.”  
Often your best play is **crash → roam** or **crash → reset**.

## Trading rules (what you’re allowed to do vs what gets you killed)

### Allowed (repeatable, low risk)
- **Q poke → back off** when he walks up to last hit
- “Hit-and-run” trades that don’t let him stick
- Punish his missed engage: if he fails his E window, you can step up and take space

### Forbidden (classic Naafiri throw patterns)
- E forward “for damage” with no exit plan
- R committing when he still has full tools and you can’t burst him quickly
- Chasing a low Sylas through the middle of the lane (that’s exactly where he turns fights)

---

## How to actually get leads vs Sylas (the consistent plan)
### 1) Win the wave, not the duel
If you can keep the wave on your side:
- Sylas has to walk up to farm
- you get safer poke windows
- your jungler can punish

### 2) Force bad recalls through tempo
A “win” is:
- chunk him
- crash wave
- reset first (or roam)
Even if you didn’t kill him, you still “won” because you got tempo and denied his ability to take over the map.

### 3) Call your jungler when the wave is perfect
The best time to gank Sylas:
- wave is on your side
- he steps up to break freeze
- he uses mobility and can’t easily escape

## Midgame plan (how Naafiri carries while Sylas wants skirmishes)
Sylas is strongest when:
- fights are messy
- people stay in range
- he can steal a high-impact ult and brawl for 10 seconds

You win by:
- playing **fog and picks**
- deleting squishies before the fight becomes a long brawl
- not front-to-back DPSing him (he’s built to survive and turn)

**Simple teamfight rule:**
> Don’t start fights by jumping Sylas. Start fights by killing the carry he can’t protect.

---

## Common death patterns (and fixes)
1) **“I dashed in and he turned it”**  
Fix: stop extended fights; commit only if burst is guaranteed.

2) **“I almost killed him but he healed and I died”**  
Fix: chunk → disengage → take tempo. Don’t keep fighting low Sylas.

3) **“I got locked down and ran down in a long lane”**  
Fix: wave toward you; don’t shove without vision; hold W defensively.

4) **“I tried to 1v1 him post‑6 and it went bad”**  
Fix: post-6, prioritize crash → roam/reset unless you have a clean window.

## Quick mental script
> “Short trades only. Wave toward me. Respect his E. Don’t chase low Sylas. Win with tempo.”

---

## Practice block (10 games)
Track ONLY these 3 things:
1) **Extended fight errors:** Did I ever stay in melee range after my first trade window? (Y/N)  
2) **Wave state:** Where was the wave when I died/got chunked? (My side / Mid / His side)  
3) **Turn deaths:** How many deaths happened after I “almost killed him”?  
   Target: **0** (if it happens, you disengage next time)

If you fix those three, this matchup stops feeling like “Sylas always outplays me” and starts feeling like “I decide when fights happen.”

# Naafiri Mid vs Zoe — Matchup Guide (Macro + Lane Script)

## Zoe spell threats (read this first)

**Zoe’s entire kill pattern is: _E (sleep) → long-range Q → passive/W burst_. Your #1 job is to avoid giving her E for free.**

- **P — More Sparkles!**: After casting a spell, Zoe’s next auto is empowered (extra magic damage). Don’t eat “free” autos after she casts.
- **Q — Paddle Star!**: Long-range skillshot Zoe can **redirect**. Damage ramps up the longer it travels in a straight line. This is the nuke that kills you after sleep.
- **W — Spell Thief**: Zoe can pick up and cast **summoner spells / active item shards**. This means her threat changes constantly (random **Ignite/Exhaust/Flash/Ghost**, etc.). After she uses a summoner spell, she also fires bonus missiles.
- **E — Sleepy Trouble Bubble (THE CC)**: Skillshot that makes you **Drowsy → then Asleep**. The **first damage** that breaks sleep is **amplified** (this is why you get 100–0’d). The bubble’s threat range is **much higher near terrain / through walls** and also spikes at level 6 with R.
- **R — Portal Jump**: Zoe blinks forward briefly, then **returns to her original spot**. It effectively increases her Q/E threat range and gives her safer angles. **Her return point is predictable**—you can punish it.

**Things you must avoid:**
1) **Getting hit by E** (especially from fog/over a wall).  
2) **Hugging walls without vision** (gives Zoe “free” bubble angles).  
3) **All-inning while she has a defensive W spell** (Exhaust/Barrier) or while E is up.  
4) **Standing still / walking in straight lines** when she has Q active.

## The matchup in one sentence

**You win by staying healthy, controlling wave position, and punishing Zoe during her “no E” windows—then converting tempo into roams, plates, and mid tower.**

Zoe wins if:
- she chips you to 60–70% HP and then lands one E,
- she keeps the wave pushing so you’re forced to farm under poke,
- you push without vision and get bubbled into a jungle gank.

---

## Your win conditions as Naafiri (vs Zoe)

### Primary win condition: “No-bubble lane + tempo advantage”
If you don’t get chunked and you avoid E, Zoe’s lane becomes annoying—but not lethal. Then you:
- crash waves on good timings,
- roam with your jungler,
- and play the map where Zoe can’t safely face-check.

### Secondary win condition: “One punish → plates → mid tower”
Zoe is fragile. If she whiffs E or wastes R aggressively, your commit threat goes way up. A single clean punish can turn into:
- forced recall → plates,
- or kill → plates → mid tower (huge).

### Tertiary win condition: “Out-sidelane and pick”
Mid game, Zoe wants picks from fog. You want picks too—but you’re better at **killing whoever rotates late** if you’re already in fog first.

---

## Lane plan by levels

### Levels 1–2: **Survive poke, don’t bleed HP**
**Your goal:** stay high HP and keep the wave from getting perma-frozen against you while you’re low.

- Stand **behind minions** at all times (minions block a lot of Zoe’s setup).
- Don’t eat passive autos: after Zoe casts a spell, assume the next auto hurts.
- Use **Q** to last-hit safely; avoid “walking up for one melee minion” if it costs 20% HP.
- If you’re forced to give up a CS or two to stay healthy, do it. Zoe’s snowball starts with chip damage.

**Common trap:** you try to trade early, lose 40% HP to Q + passive autos, and now you’re in one-bubble kill range.

---

### Levels 3–5: **Wave position + E discipline**
At this point Zoe is looking for her first real E → Q chunk.

**Your lane default should be:**  
- Keep the wave **slightly on your side** of mid (a “soft freeze” / thin-the-wave).  
This reduces:
- wall angles,
- jungle gank angles,
- and how far you need to walk up to farm.

**How you trade here:**
- Short trades only.
- You “win trades” by landing Q and healing, not by long chasing.

**When Zoe uses Q on the wave:**  
That’s often your best time to step up and hit her once (Q + back off). If she’s using Q to clear, she has fewer tools to punish your step-up.

---

### Level 6+: **Respect the range spike, punish the predictability**
Zoe becomes more lethal at 6 because:
- R gives her safer angles to throw E/Q,
- and she can fish for bubbles without committing.

**Your two rules at level 6:**
1) **Do not fight from a low HP state** unless you know E is down.  
2) **Track her return point** every time she R’s.

**Punish pattern:**  
If Zoe uses R aggressively to throw spells:
- move your camera to her **original spot**,
- be ready to land Q on her return,
- and only commit hard if you can do it without walking into E.

---

## Micro: how to not get bubbled

### Positioning rules (simple, effective)
- **Play slightly toward the center of the lane**, not glued to either wall.
- If you must play toward a side, play toward the side where:
  - you have vision,
  - and your jungler is closer.
- **Don’t stand next to the raptor wall / river wall** without vision (classic bubble-from-fog angles).
- When Zoe disappears from mid for 1–2 seconds, assume she is looking for a wall bubble angle.

### Movement rules
- Zig-zag when she has Q active.
- Don’t “sidestep once and stop.” Zoe punishes predictable movement.

### Emergency plan: if E hits you
You have a short “drowsy” window before you fall asleep.
- **Immediately back off** and break the angle Zoe wants for Q (don’t run in a straight line).
- If you have a defensive summoner (Cleanse/Barrier), use it *early enough* to deny the one-shot.
- Do **not** dash forward out of panic unless it actually breaks the combo angle; forward dashes often shorten Zoe’s Q travel time (bad).

---

## How to punish Zoe (your real windows)

### Window A: Zoe **misses E**
This is the biggest one.
- The moment E misses, **walk forward** and claim space.
- You don’t always need to all-in—sometimes you just:
  - land Q,
  - push the wave,
  - and force her to farm under tower without threatening you.

**Think “one wave of dominance.”**  
If E is down, you often get 10–15 seconds where she can’t threaten a kill—use it to:
- crash,
- ward,
- reset,
- roam,
- or chunk her.

---

### Window B: Zoe uses R aggressively
R makes her temporarily safer, but also **predictable**.
- If she R’s forward to throw Q/E, she must return to the original spot.
- Your job is to punish either:
  - the moment she returns (free Q hit), or
  - her wave state afterward (crash and leave).

**Don’t tunnel:** If you chase her portal position and forget the return, you waste the punish.

---

### Window C: Zoe burns her W shard defensively
If Zoe uses an Exhaust/Barrier shard, you usually:
- **stop forcing the kill** for the next ~20 seconds,
- shove and roam instead,
- or set up a jungle play after her defensive tool is gone.

---

## Naafiri-specific tools in this matchup

### Use your packmates as “bubble insurance”
Zoe’s E is much less scary if it hits:
- a minion,
- or a packmate,
instead of you.

**Practical tip:** When you step up to last hit, don’t be the front-most target in the lane. Let minions and your pack be in front of you.

### W (untargetable) as a dodge tool — *but don’t rely on it*
Naafiri’s W gives a brief untargetable window. In theory, it can let you dodge a critical bubble or Q if you time it well.

**But for consistency:** treat W as an “occasionally saves me” tool, not your main plan. Your main plan is still positioning behind minions and away from walls.

### E as “angle breaker”
Use E to:
- dodge the predicted Q line,
- reposition after Zoe R’s,
- or break gank + bubble setups.

Avoid using E just to “start” a trade—Zoe loves punishing predictable dashes.

---

## Wave management: the matchup is decided by wave position

### Your best default wave state
- A small enemy push into you (2–4 enemy minions advantage).
- You last-hit safely with Q.
- Zoe has to walk up to harass—making her gankable and less able to fish from fog.

### When you should hard push
Hard push when you have a clear reason:
- you want to recall,
- you want to roam,
- your jungler is about to fight for river,
- or Zoe just missed E (your “one wave of dominance”).

### When you should NOT hard push
Don’t perma-shove if:
- you have no side vision,
- your jungler is not near,
- and Zoe can throw E from fog/walls while you’re extended.

This is how you die to “bubble + jungler.”

---

## Jungler interaction (very important vs Zoe)

### How Zoe wants ganks to happen
She wants:
- you to be extended,
- she lands E,
- jungler arrives during sleep/drowsy,
- you die without counterplay.

### Your anti-gank rules
- Ward the **raptor/river entrances** early if you’re pushing.
- If you’re on the “unsafe” side (no vision), play behind the wave and give CS.
- Ping missing aggressively if Zoe leaves lane—her roam threat is often “bubble from fog,” not a full commit roam.

### How to set up your jungler to punish Zoe
Zoe is weak when:
- her E is down,
- she’s pushing,
- or she’s low after using Q to clear.

**Call for a gank on a wave that is pushing into you** (she must walk up to hit the wave, and she can’t safely side-step your jungler if she’s in the center of lane).

---

## Mid game (post-plates): how you actually win the game vs Zoe

### The big rule: don’t ARAM into bubble angles
Zoe loves 5v5 standoffs where people face-check.
You should:
- push a side wave,
- disappear into fog,
- and threaten a pick from a flank.

### Objective setup vs Zoe
- Arrive early.
- Place vision.
- **Don’t be the first person to face-check.**

If you must check a bush:
- send a teammate tank,
- or go as a group,
- or use abilities/skillshots to check.

### Pick priority
If Zoe is fed, she’s often the highest priority pick because:
- her E threatens your whole team’s ability to walk into river.
Otherwise, kill the squishy who walks first.

---

## “All-in checklist” (use this before pressing commit buttons)

Only look for a full commit if most of these are true:

- ✅ Zoe’s **E is down** OR you can force it to miss  
- ✅ Zoe does **not** have an obvious defensive W shard (Exhaust/Barrier)  
- ✅ You know where the enemy jungler is (or you have strong vision)  
- ✅ The wave is not gigantic (you won’t die to minion + Zoe)  
- ✅ You have a plan to leave afterward (not chasing into fog)

If you can’t check these boxes: **play tempo. Crash/recall/roam.**

---

## Focused learning objectives (for matchup mastery)

Pick **one** per game for 5–10 games. Track them with a simple note after each match.

### Objective 1 — “Bubble discipline”
- Track: **# of times Zoe E hits you before 14:00**.
- Goal: **0–2** per lane phase.
- Review: Where were you standing? (near wall? no minions? greedy for CS?)

### Objective 2 — “Wave on my side”
- Track: how often the wave is on your side of mid (soft freeze) vs at her tower.
- Goal: spend **more time** with the wave closer to you than to her (unless you’re crashing to recall/roam).

### Objective 3 — “Punish windows”
- Track: every time Zoe misses E, did you get a benefit?
  - chunk her,
  - crash wave,
  - ward,
  - recall,
  - roam.
- Goal: **get something every miss** (even if it’s just a clean crash + reset).

### Objective 4 — “No coinflip roams”
- Track: roams attempted vs roams that cost you a full wave + plate.
- Goal: **roam only on crash/bounce**.

### Objective 5 — “Portal punishment”
- Track: did you hit Zoe on her **R return spot** at least once in lane?
- Goal: at least **one punish** by 14 minutes.

## Common Naafiri mistakes vs Zoe (and the fix)

**Mistake:** standing near wall with no vision.  
**Fix:** play center lane, ward, and only hug a side you control.

**Mistake:** using E forward to start trades.  
**Fix:** hold E to dodge Q/E lines or to break gank setups.

**Mistake:** forcing all-in while E is up.  
**Fix:** bait E, then punish the cooldown.

**Mistake:** you get hit by E and keep walking in a straight line.  
**Fix:** instantly change angle, break the Q line, and retreat.

---

## Quick “cheat sheet” (copy/paste mental notes)

- **If Zoe E is up:** farm safe, don’t stand near walls, don’t dash predictably.  
- **If Zoe E misses:** step up, chunk, crash, ward/reset/roam.  
- **At level 6:** respect the range spike, punish the R return point.  
- **Mid game:** don’t face-check; arrive early to objectives; win with picks/tempo.

---

*Optional note (summoner choice):* If Zoe + enemy comp has multiple hard CC tools and you’re struggling to stay alive, **Cleanse** can be a practical training wheel while you learn bubble discipline. Once your “E hit count” is consistently low, you can go back to greedier summoners.

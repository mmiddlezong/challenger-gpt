# Naafiri Mid vs LeBlanc — Matchup Guide (Gameplay Focus)

> Goal: **win through tempo and map pressure**, not through forcing 1v1 all-ins into LeBlanc’s mobility.  
> Your “carry lane” is often **bot/top via roams**, while you **deny LeBlanc** the ability to freely poke + roam.

## Spell snapshot (read this first)

### LeBlanc (what can kill you)

- **E – Ethereal Chains (CC!)**: *skillshot* that hits the **first enemy hit**. If you stay tethered **~1.5s**, you get **ROOTED** and take a second damage hit.  
  **This is the spell you must avoid.** If you get rooted while she has damage ready, you can die.  
  **Counterplay:** keep **minions / packmates** between you and her, sidestep, and if you get hit **break the tether** with movement (E dash / Flash).

- **W – Distortion**: dash in → AoE damage → can **return to the pad**. This is her **main trade + escape**.  
  **Rule:** don’t hard-commit until she has spent W (or R(W)).

- **Q – Sigil of Malice**: point-and-click mark. It only “pops” if she hits you with **another ability**.  
  **Rule:** if she Q’s you, back up so she can’t easily land W/E to detonate.

- **R – Mimic**: repeats her last basic spell. At level 6+, assume she can have **double dash (W + R(W))** or **double chain (E + R(E))**.

- **Passive – Mirror Image**: when low HP she can briefly invis + spawn a clone.  
  **Rule:** don’t throw your entire kit into the wrong target—watch for the real model/pathing.

### Naafiri (your tools in this matchup)

- **W – The Call of the Pack**: **1s untargetable** on cast + short burst of power (AD/MS) + recalls pack.  
  **Primary use vs LB:** a **reaction dodge** for Chains / Mimic Chains, or a “commit safely” button.

- **E – Eviscerate**: dash + AoE.  
  **Primary use vs LB:** reposition to **break chain tether**, or to finish when she’s already spent mobility.

- **R – Hounds’ Pursuit**: targeted engage (champions only).  
  **Rule:** don’t R if you can’t answer: “What if she W’s away and I don’t kill?”

## Matchup identity (what each champion wants)

### What LeBlanc wants
- chip you down to ~60–70% HP
- threaten **Chains** so you can’t step up
- roam on waves where you can’t match

### What you want (Naafiri)
- keep HP high, keep wave stable, **earn crash timers**
- punish **W usage** (her escape cooldown)
- turn mid priority into **roams / jungle plays**
- later: play fog and delete squishies; don’t waste time “trying to catch LeBlanc forever”

**The matchup is won by:**
1) **not getting rooted**,  
2) **not bleeding HP to free Q/W poke**,  
3) **not wasting R into her mobility**,  
4) **out-tempoing her with wave + roams**.

---

## The 3 rules that make you consistent vs LeBlanc

1) **Minions/packmates must be between you and her whenever possible.**  
   Chains hits the *first* unit—treat your wave like a shield.

2) **Punish her after W.**  
   If she uses W on the wave or for a trade, she loses a huge part of her safety.  
   Your best window is the **3–8 seconds after she Distortions** (depending on distance/return choice).

3) **Your W is not a “run fast” button in this lane.**  
   Save W to deny the one spell that swings fights: **Chains (E or R(E)).**

---

## Laning plan by phases

### Levels 1–2: stabilize and deny free poke
**Objective:** leave level 2 with good HP and a controllable wave.

- Play slightly **behind your caster minions** so Chains has to pass through the wave.
- If she Q’s you, don’t immediately step forward—she wants Q → W to detonate.
- Don’t “auto for pride” and eat Q/W for it. Your HP is your lane currency.

**Win condition in this window:** clean CS + avoid being chunked.

---

### Levels 3–5: wave control + punish W usage
This is where you start “playing the matchup.”

#### What you’re looking for
- LeBlanc uses **W** to:
  - last-hit multiple minions
  - shove a wave
  - poke you when you’re near your wave

#### Your response
- If she W’s **onto you** and immediately returns: take the small loss, don’t chase.
- If she W’s **onto the wave** (especially to shove):  
  **step up and trade** (Q poke, threaten E) while her escape is limited.

#### The lane state you want
- **Freeze-ish** near your side when:
  - your jungler is pathing to you
  - you’re low HP / she has ignite pressure
- **Slow push → crash** when:
  - you want a roam or reset
  - you want to ward river and deny her roams

---

### Level 6+: respect the burst, choose commits carefully
At 6, LeBlanc becomes much better at:
- faking engages (double dash)
- double chains
- 100–0 if you get rooted while low

**Your new objective:** stop thinking “solo kill,” start thinking “force her to spend spells → win the next map play.”

#### Good R windows vs LeBlanc
- She used **W** on the wave and is stuck near lane.
- She missed **E** (or used it defensively).
- You have jungler nearby and can turn it into a 2v2.

#### Bad R windows (common throw pattern)
- You R while she has W + R available and you’re not already ahead.
- You R when you’re already marked and low enough she can outburst you if you miss.

## Trading patterns and responses (practical)

### When she starts with Q
**LB goal:** Q you → land W or E to detonate → win the trade.

**Your response:**
- Back up to max Q range and farm.
- If she walks up for W detonation, be ready to **W (untargetable)** to dodge the follow-up.

### When she starts with W (Distortion)
**LB goal:** W in for damage → Q → maybe E → return.

**Your response decision tree:**
- Did she place W pad aggressively and *stay*?  
  → **Punish**: Q trade, threaten E, consider all-in only if you can dodge Chains.
- Did she instantly return?  
  → **Don’t chase**. Use the time to:
  - fix the wave
  - get a free last-hit advantage
  - move to ward / reset

### When she throws Chains (E)
**If you dodge it:** you can play aggressively for ~10 seconds.  
**If it hits you:** your only job is to **break tether** (don’t “finish the combo,” don’t greed).

How to break tether:
- immediately **E dash** away (or diagonally) to exceed tether range
- if you still can’t break it, **Flash** early (better than dying rooted)

## Wave management script (simple and repeatable)

### Default plan (most games)
1) **Wave 1–2:** last hit, avoid poke, don’t hard shove.
2) **Wave 3:** if you’re healthy, start a **slow push**.
3) **Crash big wave:** ward one side + look for a roam or reset.

### “I’m getting bullied” plan
- Let the wave come to you, hold it near your tower without letting it crash.
- Ping for help **only after** LeBlanc uses W (or if she has to overstep).

### “My jungler is coming” plan
- Freeze on your side.
- Hold your W for Chains.
- Don’t dash forward first—make her choose between escaping and landing E.

---

## Roaming vs LeBlanc (the most important macro section)

LeBlanc *wants* to roam on you. You win by roaming on **your wave timers**, not hers.

### Your roam checklist
Only leave lane if:
- you **crashed** the wave OR the wave is bouncing back to you safely
- the roam has setup (enemy pushed, ally CC, fight already starting)
- you can be back before you lose 2 waves + plate

### If LeBlanc roams first
Don’t half-follow late. Pick one:
- **Hard shove mid → plate → ward enemy jungle**
- **Mirror instantly** if you can arrive before the fight ends

**Consistency tip:** a late follow is how you lose twice (wave + fight).

---

## Jungle interaction (how you actually kill LeBlanc)

LeBlanc is hard to gank if she has W. So don’t call ganks randomly—call them on **W cooldown windows**.

### Best gank setup
- you hold the wave near your tower
- she uses W to push/trade
- you ping **W down** and your jungler appears within ~10 seconds

### Your job in the gank
- don’t lead with E unless you must break Chains
- walk up, Q, and save W to dodge the counter Chains
- if she returns to pad, punish where she lands (don’t chase into fog)

---

## Mid game and teamfights: how to carry when LeBlanc is slippery

### Treat LeBlanc like “a cooldown champion”
She’s scary when W/R are up and she’s in fog. She’s not scary when she’s forced to show and clear waves.

**Your carry plan:**
- play side waves
- get into fog first around objectives
- delete the carry/support who face-checks
- only turn onto LeBlanc if she commits (W in)

### “Counter-assassin” option (often correct)
If LeBlanc is fed and diving your backline:
- hover your carry in key fights
- when she W’s in, you punish her exit path with R + pack damage
- you don’t need to kill her; forcing her to retreat low HP is often enough to win the fight

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** you R while she still has W and you have no guaranteed follow.  
  **Fix:** force W first (wave pressure, jungle pressure, or bait).

- **Mistake:** you get hit by Chains and try to “finish the trade.”  
  **Fix:** breaking tether is priority #1.

- **Mistake:** you use W for movement speed and then eat E/R(E).  
  **Fix:** W is your anti-CC timing tool in this lane.

- **Mistake:** you roam on a bad wave and lose mid plates.  
  **Fix:** roam only after crash/bounce.

## Learning objectives (focus blocks)

### Block A — “Chains discipline” (5 games)
**Goal:** get rooted by Chains **≤ 1 time in lane phase**.
- Track it manually after each game.
- If you’re getting rooted: review *why* (no minion shield? greedy trade? didn’t dash instantly?).

### Block B — “Punish W” (5 games)
**Goal:** every time LeBlanc uses W on the wave, you get **one of**:
- a positive trade (HP advantage),
- a wave advantage (better crash/reset),
- or a roam/ward timer.

### Block C — “R discipline” (5 games)
**Goal:** only R when at least **2 of 3** are true:
- W is down (or she already used her dash pattern),
- Chains is down/missed,
- you have follow-up (jungler / roam / numbers).

### Block D — “Tempo carry” (5 games)
**Goal:** on every cannon wave crash, do one of:
- ward,
- roam,
- reset.  
No standing mid undecided.

## Quick cheat sheet (printable)

**If you remember nothing else:**
- **Don’t get rooted.**
- **Don’t commit before W is spent.**
- **Crash → move → win map.**

**In lane:**
- Stand behind minions/packmates.
- After she W’s, you get to play.
- If E hits you: break tether immediately.

**Your best wins:**
- out-rotate her to sides
- get mid plates when she roams
- pick someone else when she refuses to be caught

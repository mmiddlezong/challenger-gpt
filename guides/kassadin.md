# Naafiri vs Kassadin (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell snapshot (what to respect / what to dodge)

### Kassadin (things that stop your tempo)
- **Q — Null Sphere (targeted poke)**: point-and-click damage + shield for Kassadin. **You cannot sidestep it**; your main outplay is **Naafiri W untargetable** or spacing so he can’t safely click you.
- **W — Nether Blade (empowered auto)**: short trade tool + auto reset. Respect it when you walk up to last-hit.
- **E — Force Pulse (AOE cone + _slow_)**: **his only real CC is the slow.** If you get slowed at the wrong time, you lose your stickiness and become gankable.
- **R — Riftwalk (blink + AOE damage)**: post-6 he can **dodge angles, escape ganks, and punish over-commit**. The more he casts it in a short time, the more costly/strong it becomes—don’t chase deep into fog.

### Naafiri (your matchup tools)
- **Q — Darkin Daggers**: lane control + sustain + “bleed pop” finisher. This is how you keep HP high while bullying.
- **W — The Call of the Pack**: **1s untargetable** + burst window. This is your “deny the click” button vs **Kassadin Q**, and your best way to avoid **E slow / Riftwalk damage** during commits.
- **E — Eviscerate**: dash + burst + pack refresh. **Save it** to follow his first Riftwalk, or to dodge Force Pulse.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit**: champion-only commit. Use it when Kassadin is **low / isolated / already used Riftwalk**, or when you have backup.

**CC to avoid:** Kassadin **E slow** (and any follow-up CC from jungler/support).  
**Big rule:** Don’t spend **R** unless you know what the next 10 seconds looks like.

## Matchup identity (one sentence)
You are **stronger early** and win by **denying Kassadin a free level-6/level-11 game** through wave control, plates, roams, and tempo; Kassadin wins if you stall into a clean scaling mid game.

---

## Win conditions

### Your win condition (Naafiri)
1. **Build an early lead pre-6** (HP/CS denial, plate gold, or a roam kill).
2. **Take mid plates / mid tower** to unlock fog + side-lane picks.
3. **End through objectives and picks** before Kassadin becomes uncatchable.

### Kassadin’s win condition
1. Survive lane without losing plates.
2. Hit **6** safely, then **11/16** with items.
3. Riftwalk around fights, delete a carry, and never let you get a clean commit.

---

## Runes + summoners (practical, not dogmatic)

### Summoners
- **Ignite** if you want the cleanest “Kassadin doesn’t get to scale” plan (best for solo-kill + snowball).
- **Teleport** if your priority is tempo resets + cross-map plays (safer if both junglers are volatile).

### Rune direction (choose the one you actually execute)
- **Burst/kill pressure:** take a burst setup that rewards short trades and all-in windows.
- **Extended skirmish:** take a setup that helps you win longer 2v2s with your jungler.
- **If you struggle surviving post-6 trades:** add defensive secondaries (sustain/tenacity) rather than “hoping to outplay every time.”

*(Exact rune pages shift patch-to-patch—your **lane plan** matters more than the keystone.)*

---

## Items (simple rules)
- **Your first goal:** early damage to threaten kills and take plates.
- **If Kassadin starts chunking you after 6:** buy an **early MR component** (even a small one) so you keep tempo instead of being forced into bad recalls.
- **If the enemy team has lots of CC:** consider a spell-shield item later—but Kassadin himself doesn’t provide hard CC.

---

## Lane plan: the first 6 waves (your “script”)

### Goal for waves 1–3: get a clean crash without losing HP
**Wave 1**
- Start **Q** and play for **HP preservation + light poke**.
- Tag Kassadin when he walks up for a last hit **only if you don’t eat Q for free**.
- Don’t stand in the open trading autos into his minions.

**Wave 2**
- Keep a small minion lead and continue a **slow push**.
- **Punish when he uses Q on a minion** (that’s your safest short window to poke/trade).
- Don’t burn **E** early unless you’re dodging something important or setting up a guaranteed chunk.

**Wave 3 (cannon wave)**
- **Hard shove and crash.** This is your first tempo window.
- After crash, choose ONE:
  1) **ward** (raptors/river entrance),  
  2) **cheater reset** (buy + return with tempo), or  
  3) **roam with jungler** (invade / river fight).

> Consistency rule: if you can’t name a play after the crash, **reset**.

---

### Goal for waves 4–6: create a bounce → deny farm → threaten a gank
After you crash wave 3, the wave usually **bounces back** toward you.

**Wave 4**
- Let it come in and set up a **freeze-ish** position on your side.
- Kassadin hates walking up pre-6. Make him choose between:
  - losing CS, or
  - stepping up into your Q + threat.

**Wave 5**
- Hold the freeze as long as it’s safe (watch jungle).
- If he tries to break it, thin the wave with Q and keep it on your side.

**Wave 6 (the level-6 moment)**
- When Kassadin hits 6, your solo-kill window shrinks.
- Your priorities become:
  - **don’t donate a death**,  
  - **keep wave control**,  
  - **roam/plate with tempo**.

If you didn’t secure anything pre-6, don’t panic—your job is now to **play the map cleaner than him**.

## Trading rules (how to actually win exchanges)

### Pre-6 (this is where you should be winning)
- **Short trade pattern:** Q poke → wait → Q “pop” on bleed target when safe.
- **Best punish window:** Kassadin uses **Q** on the wave → you step up for a trade.
- **Avoid:** face-tanking his Q + W empowered auto just to land a single auto.

### Post-6 (don’t flip your lead away)
- **Never spend E first** unless you’re dodging a key spell. If you E in, he Riftwalks out and you lose tempo.
- **Track his Riftwalk usage:**
  - If he **R’s to farm** or **R’s aggressively**, that’s your moment to threaten a real fight or call your jungler.
  - If he hasn’t used R yet, assume he’s holding it to dodge your commit.

### Using W correctly vs Kassadin
- If you are committing: **hold W to deny his Q click** or to dodge the **E slow** at the moment you need stickiness most.
- W is also your “I refuse your burst timing” button if he Riftwalks onto you in range.

---

## Kill windows (when you should actually go for it)

### Real kill windows (green lights)
- Kassadin is **pre-6** and past the midpoint with no flash.
- Kassadin is **low enough** that your Q pop + follow-up guarantees the kill.
- Kassadin just used **Riftwalk** (especially to farm or trade) and you can punish before he exits the lane.
- Your jungler is nearby and you can **hold the wave** for a clean gank.

### Fake kill windows (red flags)
- You’re trying to all-in post-6 while he has **R + Flash** and you have no angle.
- You are committing while your wave is bad (you’ll lose 1–2 waves + plate if it fails).
- You’re chasing him into fog where he can Riftwalk over walls and turn with help.

---

## Roaming vs Kassadin (how you “carry” the matchup)

### Pre-6: roam is extremely high value
Kassadin generally can’t follow quickly. Your best roams are:
- **crash → bot dive/river skirmish**
- **crash → invade with jungler**
- **crash → reset and return stronger**

### Post-6: roam only off a crash (or he matches)
After 6, Kassadin can match roams with Riftwalk.
So:
- **push first**, then move
- prefer **short, guaranteed** roams (setup + vision + CC)
- if roam isn’t real, **take plates** or **reset**

---

## Mid game plan (minutes ~10–20)
This is where games are decided vs Kassadin.

1. **Take mid tower** as early as you can. It unlocks fog routes where Naafiri thrives.
2. Stop living mid permanently:
   - catch wave → push → disappear into fog
3. Play objective setups:
   - arrive early, control ward, wait for a face-check
4. Pick the *late rotator*:
   - Kassadin wants to flank—punish the support/ADC who walks in alone.

---

## Teamfight rules vs Kassadin
- You are **not** starting front-to-back 5v5s into a scaling Kassadin.
- You want:
  - flanks,
  - picks,
  - cleanup after someone spends key cooldowns.

**Your best fight pattern:**
- show on wave → go dark → wait → delete a squishy → take objective  
(not “R into 5 and pray”).

---

## Common mistakes in this matchup (and the fix)

### Mistake: “I didn’t kill him by 6, so I’m losing”
**Fix:** You can still win by **plates + roams + mid tower**. Kassadin scaling is real, but tempo wins games.

### Mistake: perma-push with no vision
**Fix:** crash intentionally, ward on the correct timer, and **don’t stand mid past river** when your W/E are down.

### Mistake: using E as an opener post-6
**Fix:** hold E to follow his Riftwalk or dodge Force Pulse.

### Mistake: chasing Kassadin through fog
**Fix:** convert your pressure into **tower/objective** instead. Kassadin loves long chases.

## Quick checklist (use every game)

### Before level 6
- [ ] Did I get at least one clean crash (wave 3) and a real tempo action?
- [ ] Did I keep my HP high enough to threaten?
- [ ] Did I deny CS with a freeze/bounce at least once?
- [ ] Did I convert pressure into a plate / roam / invade?

### After level 6
- [ ] Am I only roaming off crashes?
- [ ] Am I holding W for the key moment (Q click / E slow / R burst timing)?
- [ ] Am I committing R only when Kassadin can’t trivially escape?
- [ ] Am I trading picks for objectives instead of chasing?

---

## Simple “carry loop” vs Kassadin
1. Slow push → crash → ward/reset/roam  
2. Bounce → freeze/deny → chunk  
3. Convert advantage into **plates → mid tower**  
4. Use fog to pick side-laners and end through objectives before Kassadin hits full scaling

# Naafiri vs Lissandra (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first)

### Lissandra: what can stop you (CC / lockdown)
- **Q — Ice Shard:** line poke that **slows**. Gets easier for her to land follow-up CC when you’re slowed.
- **W — Ring of Frost:** **instant AoE root around Lissandra.**  
  **This is the “don’t R into her” button.** If she still has W available, most straight all-ins are losing or at best a trade of flashes.
- **E — Glacial Path:** long “ice claw” skillshot that she can **recast to blink** to it.  
  This is both her **escape** *and* her “I’m setting up a gank / engage” tool (E → blink → W root).
- **R — Frozen Tomb:** **targeted, instant stun** on an enemy champion (or self-cast stasis + heal).  
  If she has R + you don’t have a plan, you will get stopped mid-dive and die.

### Naafiri: your answers (how you avoid dying)
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** short buff + **1s untargetable on cast** (you + pack).  
  Use it as a **timing tool** (deny being targetable / dodge a key spell window), *not* just for movespeed.
- **E — Eviscerate:** your **reposition** tool. Hold it to dodge the one spell that matters (often her E claw line or gank CC) and to exit after a trade.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** **targeted champion-only commit** (not blockable by other champs).  
  In this matchup, treat R like: **“I’m committing to a play that already has an advantage.”**

**Hard rule:** If Lissandra has **W + R** available and you don’t have **spell-shield / jungler / clear flank**, you generally **don’t get to force** on her. You win by tempo, wave control, and map plays.

## Matchup identity: what this lane really is
Lissandra is an **anti-assassin**. She’s built to:
- survive your first commit,
- lock you down when you go in,
- and punish you with jungle help at level 6.

So your win condition is usually:
1) **Stay healthy + don’t give her free kill windows**  
2) **Create tempo crashes**  
3) **Roam / play 2v2 with your jungler**  
4) **Carry mid-game through picks on side lanes and rotations** — not by “solo killing Lissandra on cooldown”.

---

## Pre-game setup

### Summoners
- **Flash + Ignite** (default): best when you plan to snowball off **roams** and punish side lanes.
- **Flash + Teleport** (safer/tempo): if you expect a low-kill lane and want guaranteed resets + side lane control.

### Rune goal (don’t overthink it)
Pick a page that supports **short burst trades** + **not getting bullied out of lane**.
- **Electrocute** style: better if you want to punish mistakes and skirmish.
- **First Strike** style: better if you’re confident you can avoid getting poked for free and want bigger mid-game bursts.

Secondary runes: prioritize **lane durability** (anti-poke) or **tenacity/slow resist** if their team has lots of CC.

### Starting items
- **Doran’s Shield** if she’s poking you constantly with Q and you need stability.
- **Long Sword + Refillable** if you’re confident in spacing and want earlier lethality spike.

---

## Lane plan: levels 1–5 (your job is to not “lose the lane for her”)

### Wave 1–2: don’t eat free Qs
**Goal:** hit level 3 with good HP.
- Last hit with **Q** when possible.
- Don’t step forward just to auto if it means taking Q + minion aggro.
- If she Qs the wave, you get a small window to walk up for CS.

**Spacing rule:** stay outside her **W zone**. If she can blink (E) + W you, you’re in “gank setup” danger.

### Wave 3–5: “thin → crash → choose”
Your first *good* tempo window usually comes from a clean crash.
- If she’s hard pushing you: **thin the wave** with Q and let it come closer to your turret.
- If you can build a slow push: stack 2 waves → **crash** → then do ONE thing:
  1) ward,
  2) roam,
  3) reset.

**Do not** stand mid after crash doing nothing.

---

## The first 6 waves script (simple + repeatable)

### Option A (most consistent): let her push → hold near your side → crash later
1. **Wave 1:** last-hit only; keep HP high.
2. **Wave 2:** thin with Q so you don’t get a huge wave under tower.
3. **Wave 3:** you have E now — use it *defensively* if needed; keep wave on your side.
4. **Wave 4:** start building a slow push back by clearing the backline with Q when safe.
5. **Wave 5:** stack the wave; look to crash on wave 5 or 6.
6. **After crash:** ward a jungle entrance or reset for item/HP tempo.

### Option B (when she plays very passive): fast crash → ward → bounce
If she’s not contesting and you can push safely:
- push wave 2–3 hard → crash → **ward one side** → let it bounce back to you.

---

## Warding and jungle threat (the “don’t die to Lissandra” section)

Lissandra’s easiest wins come from **E → blink → W root** into jungle follow-up, or level 6 dives with **R**.

### Your default ward timing
- **Around 2:45–3:15:** ward the side your jungler is *not* on (or the side you’re leaning toward).
- After your first crash: **deeper ward** on a raptor entrance / river bush so you see rotations sooner.

### When to respect ganks HARD
- you’re **below ~70% HP**,
- your **E is down**,
- Lissandra has **E available** and is walking at you,
- or she hit a **Q slow** and the enemy jungler is missing.

If any of those are true, back off and farm with Q.

---

## Trading patterns that work (and ones that lose)

### Winning trade: “Q poke + pop, no commit”
- Q to tag her when she walks up → wait → Q pop when safe → back off.
This keeps you healthy and denies her “I got you low enough to all-in with jungle” plan.

### Winning trade: “bait W first”
You can look for a real all-in only when one of these happens:
- she uses **W** for wave/spacing,
- she uses **E** and can’t safely blink away,
- she’s low enough that your R → burst is guaranteed,
- or your jungler is there to force her cooldowns.

### Losing trade: “E forward for ego”
If you E forward while she has W up, you’re volunteering to get rooted and chunked.
Use E to **dodge**, to **finish**, or to **exit**, not as your opener.

---

## Level 6+ rules: how you stop throwing the lane

### Identify the “no-go” state
If Lissandra has **R up** and you don’t have:
- a **spell shield** ready, or
- a **numbers advantage** (jungler nearby / 2v2 you win), or
- a **clean flank** where she can’t instantly W/R you…

…then you do **not** force onto her. You push, move, and kill other people.

### Your “go” state (when you can actually commit)
Commit windows often look like:
- She used **R** defensively in a skirmish.
- She used **W** and can’t stop your R follow-through.
- You have **spell-shield up** (common mid-game solution) and she can’t pop it safely.
- She burned **Flash** recently.

**Mindset:** You’re waiting for her to spend her “stop assassin” tools on *something else*.

---

## How to carry the matchup anyway (your real win conditions)

### Win condition 1: crash → move first → 2v2 with jungler
Naafiri thrives when you turn mid into:
> “If you enter river/jungle without vision, you die.”

After crash:
- hover your jungler on river fights,
- invade entrances,
- collapse on side lanes.

### Win condition 2: punish her roams correctly
Lissandra roams well, but she can’t be in two places at once.
When she leaves lane, you choose **fast**:
- **Match** only if you can arrive in time to matter, **or**
- **Hard shove + take plates/vision** if you’re late.

Matching late is the classic assassin mistake: you lose wave *and* arrive after the fight.

### Win condition 3: mid-game fog picks (not front-to-back 5v5)
In fights:
- don’t R first into her,
- approach from fog,
- wait for her W/R to be used,
- then delete the carry.

---

## Itemization and defensive tools (the “I refuse to be point-and-clicked” section)

You don’t need to build full defense, but you *do* need answers.

### Boots
- **Mercury’s Treads** are very strong if their team has multiple CC sources (Liss + jungle/support).
- Damage boots can work if the game is low CC and you’re snowballing — but be honest.

### One defensive purchase that changes the matchup
- **A spell shield item** is extremely valuable because it forces Lissandra to **break shield first** before she can reliably lock you with R/W.  
  If she can’t pop it safely, you get much more freedom to threaten picks.

### MR options (when you’re getting bullied)
- Early **magic resist component** buys can stabilize lane without ruining your damage curve.
- If Lissandra is fed or their comp is AP-heavy, consider a proper MR defensive item earlier than you normally would.

*(Exact item names shift over seasons/patches — the principle is: spell shield + tenacity/MR beats “I die to one button.”)*

## Mid game & teamfights: practical execution

### What you should be doing
- Catch a wave → push → disappear into fog.
- Set up objectives early (arrive 45–60s before) and sit in a dark pocket with a control ward.
- Look for picks on:
  1) ADC / immobile mage,
  2) enchanter support,
  3) anyone face-checking.

### What you should NOT be doing
- R-ing onto Lissandra first when she has cooldowns.
- Diving a grouped team with no flank.
- Chasing her through fog when her **E** is available.

### If Lissandra is the one engaging
If she E-blinks in:
- assume **W root** is coming immediately,
- hold your W/E to deny the chain,
- then turn on whoever followed her (often easier to kill than Liss herself).

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** “I can outplay her R with mechanics.”  
  **Fix:** Treat R as “instant stop.” Play around cooldown state, spell shield, or numbers.
- **Mistake:** E forward, get rooted, lose half HP, can’t lane.  
  **Fix:** E is for dodge/finish/exit.
- **Mistake:** Roam on a wave pushing away from you.  
  **Fix:** Roam only after crash/bounce.
- **Mistake:** You chase into her E path and die to jungle.  
  **Fix:** When her claw is out, assume she has backup.

---

## Quick in-game checklist (use this every wave crash)
1. **Where is enemy jungler likely?** (last seen + lanes pushing)
2. **Does Lissandra have W/R right now?**
3. **Do I have a 70%+ roam or skirmish?**
4. If not: **ward or reset**. Don’t idle mid.

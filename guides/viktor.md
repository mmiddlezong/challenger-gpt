# Naafiri Mid vs Viktor — Matchup Guide (macro + execution)

## Viktor spell quicksheet (what to respect)

**Passive — Glorious Evolution**
- Viktor gains *Hex Fragments* on kills. Every 100 fragments he permanently **augments** one ability; after all basic spells are upgraded, he can upgrade his ultimate too. citeturn1view0  
- Practical meaning: his lane gets noticeably stronger in “steps” (first upgrade is usually his waveclear or trading tool).

**Q — Siphon Power (short trade tool)**
- Targeted damage that gives Viktor a **shield** and empowers his next auto for extra damage. citeturn2search2  
- **Thing to avoid:** taking Q + empowered auto for free when you walk up for CS (this is how he “wins” lane without killing you).

**W — Gravity Field (THE CC)**
- Places a zone that **slows**, and if you stay inside long enough you get **stunned**. citeturn2search2  
- **This is the #1 thing you must not eat.** If you ever get stunned in lane, you’re usually dead to a gank or forced to burn Flash.

**E — Hextech Ray / Death Ray (main poke + wave control)**
- A long line laser that hits everything in its path. citeturn2search2  
- **Augment:** after upgrade, an **explosion follows the laser’s wake** (second hit zone). citeturn2search2  
- **Thing to avoid:** getting clipped while you’re last-hitting *and* taking the aftershock/explosion later.

**R — Arcane Storm / Chaos Storm (zone + finish)**
- Drops a storm that deals damage and **interrupts channeled abilities** on cast; it keeps dealing AoE damage and Viktor can redirect it. citeturn0search6turn2search2  
- **Thing to avoid:** committing to a long fight while the storm sits on you. Either burst and leave, or don’t take the fight.

### “Do NOT let this happen” list
1. You **R in**, Viktor drops **W under you**, you get **stunned**, and you die.
2. You lose 50% HP to repeated **E lasers** before level 6 (no kill pressure, no roam pressure).
3. You take trades *into* Viktor **Q shield + empowered auto** (you’ll always lose the short trade).

# The matchup in one sentence
Viktor wants to **chip you down with E** and win lane through **safe short trades** (Q + auto) while holding **W stun** to punish your all-in; you win by **staying healthy**, forcing **tempo windows** (crash → reset/roam), and only committing when **Gravity Field is down or useless**.

---

# Your game plan as Naafiri (lane → midgame)

## Core win condition vs Viktor
**You do not have to solo-kill Viktor to win the matchup.** Your consistent win pattern is:

1) **Don’t get poked out** (HP is your resource)  
2) Create a **clean crash** on a good wave  
3) Use crash to **reset/ward/roam**  
4) Use level 6+ threat to punish him when he steps too far **without W available**  
5) Transition into **fog-based picks** and avoid Viktor’s preferred front-to-back 5v5

---

# Laning phase (detailed)

## Levels 1–2: “HP preservation and wave shape”
**Goal:** arrive at level 3 with enough HP to actually threaten trades and contest wave states.

- Stand **slightly off-center** from the minion wave (Viktor’s E is easiest when you line up with minions).
- Last-hit calmly; don’t walk into Q range just to auto a minion if it means eating Q+auto.
- If Viktor is hard pushing with E, accept it early: let the wave come closer so you’re harder to gank and safer to farm.

**Mental cue:** Viktor’s best early lane is when you “help him” by standing still to last-hit.

---

## Levels 3–5: “Win via crashes, not slugfests”
At this stage Viktor’s pattern is:
- E you when you step up
- Q+auto you if you get close
- Hold W to punish your commit

Your job:
- **Take trades only when your Q hits and you don’t eat E for it.**
- Aim for **slow push → crash** so you earn a tempo choice (reset/ward/roam).

### How to trade without losing lane
**Good trade:**
- Viktor walks up for a last-hit → you Q him while staying out of Q range → back up.
- If he answers with E, you’re already moving.

**Bad trade:**
- You step into Q range, he Q’s you (shield), auto’s you, then lasers you on exit.

### Wave management rule that wins this matchup
- If you are getting poked, keep the wave **closer to your side**. Viktor has no dash, and he hates being extended versus ganks.
- If you are healthy and see the enemy jungler elsewhere, you can **slow push** to crash and roam/reset.

**Important:** don’t roam off a wave that’s slow-pushing away from you. You’ll lose 1–2 waves *and* Viktor gets free plates.

---

## Level 6+: “Threaten, don’t coinflip”
Once you have your ultimate, Viktor must respect your commit — *but only if you respect W*.

### Your all-in checklist (must be mostly “yes”)
- ✅ Viktor’s **W is down** OR he used it badly (not under his feet / not on your landing zone)
- ✅ You are not already at 60% HP from poke
- ✅ You know where the junglers are (or have vision)
- ✅ The wave state won’t punish you (you can crash/deny after)

### If W is up, here’s the correct mindset
Treat Viktor W like a “tax” on your engage:
- If you R in while it’s up, assume it will be placed **on you**.
- Plan your exit immediately: **E out of the field** *before* you can be stunned.

# Ability usage notes (Naafiri-specific to Viktor)

## Your W (Call of the Pack): use it like an outplay tool, not just damage
Call of the Pack makes you **untargetable briefly** (1 second) per the midscope notes. citeturn0search2  
In this matchup, that window is best used to:
- avoid being hit by a key spell in the trade window (often **E** or the moment you commit),
- prevent targeted damage during your entry,
- buy just enough time to reposition before Viktor drops W.

**Common mistake:** pressing W early “for speed”, then having nothing to protect you when Viktor fights back.

## Your E: your anti-Gravity Field button
Your E dash is your main way to:
- reposition off Viktor’s laser line
- **leave Gravity Field** before you’re stunned

If you ever get stunned by W in lane, treat it as a major mistake to fix immediately.

## Your R: commit only when you can *finish* or *leave*
Viktor’s kit punishes “half-commits”:
- If you don’t kill quickly, he slows/stuns you and turns with R + E.

So your R usage should be either:
- “I kill him or force Flash”
- or “I trade, then disengage instantly and take the wave/tempo”

# Jungle interaction (how to actually get ahead)

## How to set up ganks *for your jungler*
Viktor has no dash. He is extremely gankable **when extended** and when his W is down.

Your best gank setup pattern:
1) Let Viktor push (don’t fight the push)  
2) Hold the wave closer to your side  
3) Ping your jungler to path mid  
4) When jungler arrives, you commit *after* Viktor uses W or when he can’t place it effectively

**Avoid:** calling for ganks while you’re perma-shoving into his tower (you’re removing the gank angle).

## How to survive ganks
Viktor’s W is a great gank tool. If enemy jungler is nearby:
- never fight inside Gravity Field
- save your dash to **exit the field**, not to enter

---

# Mid game plan (where you win the matchup)

Viktor becomes a monster in organized 5v5s because:
- W controls space (slow → stun)
- R forces people off an area
- E chunks and clears waves quickly

So your job is to **not play his game**.

## Your best midgame pattern vs Viktor
- Push a wave → disappear into fog → threaten a pick  
- Catch rotations (supports/ADCs moving to dragon/baron vision)  
- Fight in open space or from flank angles, not in narrow chokes where Viktor W/R dominate.

## Teamfights (simple rules)
- Don’t be the first person in.
- Wait for Viktor to use **W** or **R**.
- Then flank the backline; if Viktor turns on you, exit quickly and re-enter.

# Practical scripts you can run in game

## Script A: “I can’t kill him, so I win with tempo”
1) Farm safely, keep HP high  
2) Crash wave 3–4 or 5–6  
3) Reset (don’t linger)  
4) Repeat until you get a roam timer  
5) Convert roam into plates/objective elsewhere

## Script B: “He used W on wave”
This is a *real* window:
- Step up and pressure him (Q poke, threaten engage)
- Crash wave if possible
- If he’s low enough, it’s one of your safest times to commit

## Script C: “He upgraded E (aftershock)”
From this point:
- expect double-hit poke  
- don’t stand in predictable last-hit spots  
- consider giving up a single CS rather than losing 20% HP

---

# Learning objectives (focus games)

Pick **one** objective per 3–5 games.

### Objective 1 — “Zero Gravity Field stuns in lane”
- Success condition: you get **stunned 0 times** by Viktor W before plates fall.
- If you fail: write down *why* (R in without plan? tried to last-hit inside W? panicked?).

### Objective 2 — “Laser discipline”
- Success condition: by 10 minutes, you’ve been hit by Viktor E **≤ 6 times**.
- Tip: most E hits happen when you stand still to last-hit. Move *as* you last-hit.

### Objective 3 — “Crash → choice every time”
- Success condition: whenever you crash a wave, you do one of: **reset / ward / roam** (no idle time mid).
- Review: count how many crashes you wasted.

### Objective 4 — “Only R when W is solved”
- Success condition: you only cast R if:
  - W is down, OR
  - you have a guaranteed way to dash out instantly without being stunned.

# Common mistakes (and the fix)

**Mistake:** You eat Q+auto trades repeatedly.  
**Fix:** don’t stand in Q range for CS; trade with Q poke and back up.

**Mistake:** You engage while low HP from lasers.  
**Fix:** respect your HP threshold; reset earlier instead of “one more wave”.

**Mistake:** You R in and get stunned by W.  
**Fix:** treat W as the gatekeeper—either bait it, force it on wave, or be ready to E out immediately.

**Mistake:** You try to 5v5 front-to-back into Viktor.  
**Fix:** flank, pick, or pressure side lanes; fight from angles, not through his zone control.

# Quick reminder checklist (read this in loading screen)
- “My #1 rule: **don’t get stunned by Gravity Field.**” citeturn2search2  
- “My lane win is **HP + tempo**, not endless trades.”  
- “Crash waves, then make a choice (reset/ward/roam).”  
- “If Viktor scales into clean 5v5s, the game gets harder — so I play for picks and flanks.”

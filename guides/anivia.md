# Naafiri vs Anivia (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (what you MUST respect)

### Anivia — the things that stop you
- **Passive (Rebirth)**: If she would die, she turns into an **egg**. If the egg isn’t killed, she **revives**.  
  **Translation:** don’t “coinflip all-in” unless you can kill *both* Anivia **and** the egg (or your jungler is there).
- **Q (Flash Frost)**: Long skillshot orb; when it explodes it **STUNS**. It also **Chills** (slow).  
  **This is the spell you play around.** If you get hit, she’ll usually follow with **E** for big damage.
- **W (Crystallize)**: Creates an **impassable wall** (terrain).  
  **Translation:** she can trap you inside **R**, cut off your retreat, or block your engage angle.
- **E (Frostbite)**: Point‑and‑click burst. **Deals DOUBLE damage** if you’re **Chilled** (from Q or her fully formed R).  
  **Rule:** if you’re Chilled and she’s in range, *disengage*.
- **R (Glacial Storm)**: Big AoE that **slows** and zones. If you stand in it, you’re setting up her **double‑damage E**.  
  **Rule:** don’t fight “inside the blizzard” unless you’re already winning the trade.

### Naafiri — your matchup tools
- **Q (Darkin Daggers)**: Safe last‑hit/poke + sustain. Your “stay healthy” button.
- **W (The Call of the Pack)**: **1 second untargetable** + short steroid + pack refresh.  
  **Use W as your anti‑Q button**, not as a random movespeed buff.
- **E (Eviscerate)**: Short dash for reposition + resets/recalls packmates. Your “don’t get trapped” tool.
- **R (Hounds’ Pursuit)**: Targeted champion commit (no minion escape). Big burst + takedown-based recast/shield.  
  **Only press R when you know the next 10 seconds.**

---

## Matchup in one sentence
**You win by staying healthy early, punishing Anivia’s Q cooldown, and turning tempo windows into roams/picks — not by brute-forcing fights inside her R.**

---

## Runes, sums, and starting items

### Summoner spells
- **Flash + Ignite (default):** best for solo kill threat and actually finishing **egg**.
- **Flash + Teleport (if you’re high-elo / disciplined):** only if you consistently crash/reset and you’re not relying on solo kills.

### Runes (2 reliable pages)
**Page A (burst windows / kill egg faster):**
- Domination: **Hail of Blades** → Sudden Impact → (your preferred) → Treasure Hunter  
- Sorcery: Transcendence + Scorch (or Nimbus Cloak)

**Page B (extended fights / skirmishes with jungler):**
- Precision: **Conqueror** → Triumph → Legend (Haste/Alacrity) → Coup de Grace / Last Stand  
- Domination: Sudden Impact + Treasure Hunter (or your preferred)

> Pick **Hail of Blades** if you want the “one clean punish” playstyle.  
> Pick **Conqueror** if games are turning into longer fights and you need more sustained damage to finish egg.

### Starting items
- **Doran’s Shield + 1 pot (recommended):** safest into Anivia poke + Q/E chunks.
- **Long Sword + 3 pots (greedy):** if you’re confident dodging Q and want earlier lethal.

Early buy priorities:
- **Boots early** (Tier 1 ASAP) → makes Q dodging dramatically easier.
- Consider **early MR** (Null‑Magic Mantle / Hexdrinker path) if she’s ahead or their jungle is AP.

## The lane plan (phase-by-phase)

### Levels 1–2: “Don’t get chunked”
**Goal:** reach level 3 with good HP so Anivia can’t control you with one Q hit.

**Rules:**
- Don’t walk into Q range “just to auto.” Take CS with Q when needed.
- Stand slightly off-center so her Q isn’t an easy straight line.
- If she throws Q and misses, that’s your first mini‑window to step up for CS and a quick Q trade.

**Trade you’re looking for (only if safe):**
- **Q poke → back off.** You’re not committing yet.

---

### Level 3–5: “Wall exists now — stop dashing for ego”
Once Anivia has **W (wall)**, your deaths usually look like:
> you step too far → wall cuts you off → Q stun → E double damage → you can’t leave

**Rules:**
- Keep **E** available when you’re past river. Don’t spend it to “start trades.”
- Play to one side of the lane (the side you have warded), so wall + jungle gank is less deadly.

**Your best window to trade:**
- **After she uses Q** (on wave or misses).  
  If Q is down, her ability to stop you is massively lower.

**Wave goal:**
- Try to create a **crash** before level 6 for a clean **reset** (boots + damage) or a quick **roam**.

---

### Level 6+: “She can perma-clear; you must be the one moving first”
At 6, Anivia’s **R** changes lane. She can clear waves quickly and fight in her zone.

**Your kill condition becomes simpler (and stricter):**
1. **Bait/dodge Q**, or see it used on wave  
2. Don’t start the fight inside her R  
3. Commit with R when you have space to leave after the burst

**If she plays safe:**
- You’re not required to solo kill her.
- You win by **crash → disappear → threaten bot/top/jungle** while she’s stuck mid clearing.

---

## The first 6 waves: a concrete lane script

### Wave 1 (meet in lane)
- Last hit only. Use Q for hard CS you’d otherwise miss.
- Hold HP. Getting hit by Q at level 1–2 is how you lose lane tempo.

### Wave 2 (level 2 pressure)
- Respect the **Q → E** chunk.
- If she uses Q on the wave, you can walk up for a short trade (Q poke) and back off.

### Wave 3 (level 3 + first gank timing)
- Place your **first ward** around the typical early-gank window (varies by jungle path).  
  If you don’t have prio: ward **river brush**. If you do have prio: ward **raptors/side entrance**.
- Do not dash forward with E unless you see enemy jungle elsewhere.

### Wave 4–5 (set up a crash or a freeze)
Pick ONE:
- **Freeze near your side** (best to set up your jungler vs immobile Anivia), or
- **Slow push → crash** for a tempo reset.

### Wave 6 (post-crash decision)
After a crash, always choose:
- reset (most consistent), OR
- roam with a real setup, OR
- ward/invade *with your jungler*

No “standing mid” after a crash.

## Trading patterns that actually work

### 1) “Q poke + heal” lane trading (default)
- Use Q to last-hit and tag her when she steps up.
- You’re looking for **repeatable small wins**, not a 100–0.

**Do NOT trade when:**
- you’re **Chilled**
- her Q is up and you’re in a straight line
- the wave is pushing away from you and you’ll lose 2 waves for a bad trade

---

### 2) The punish window (Q down)
When Anivia Q is down, you can play more aggressively for ~one rotation.

**Good punish:**
- Step up → Q to apply pressure → if she panics and walls, back off and reset wave.

**Great punish (if she’s in kill range):**
- Hold W for her attempt to stun/peel, then commit with R *after* you’ve avoided the stun.

---

### 3) The all-in (only with a real kill plan)
**You should all-in Anivia when:**
- her Q is down OR you are confident you can dodge it
- you have enough damage/resources to kill **egg** (ignite, cooldowns, pack alive)
- you aren’t under threat of a countergank

**Practical all-in flow:**
1. Bait Q (small step-up), sidestep or W-timing to avoid the stun  
2. R commit when she’s exposed  
3. Burst her → if she eggs, immediately swap mindset to **DPS the egg** (autos + pack)  
4. If you can’t finish egg fast, **disengage** — don’t die to jungle + wall + R.

> **Egg rule:** If you don’t have enough damage to kill egg, treat “forcing egg + resetting” as a *win* only if you don’t die and you can convert it into tempo (plates/roam/vision).

---

## Playing around Anivia’s wall + R (the anti-tilt section)

### Don’t get walled into the blizzard
If you fight in a narrow corridor (river entrance, jungle choke), Anivia becomes 2x stronger because wall guarantees R value.

**Prefer fighting:**
- in open lane space
- on the side you have vision control
- after you’ve already dodged Q

### Don’t chase through R
Anivia wants you to chase her into R so her E doubles and you can’t leave.

**Your rule:**
- If she drops R and backs up, *step out*, then re-approach from a new angle (fog / side).

---

## How to use your jungler to “break” Anivia

Anivia is immobile; if you create the right wave, she’s gankable even with wall/Q.

### Best gank setup
- Keep the wave **slightly on your side** (freeze-ish).
- Hold your commit until she uses Q, or let your jungler force it.

### What you’re trying to achieve
- **Force egg** → then either finish it with numbers, or reset and repeat.
- Burning her Flash is huge because she has no dash and wall is predictable.

**Important:** Don’t dive egg without a wave unless you know exactly how you’re dropping tower shots and escaping. Anivia’s stall tools punish sloppy dives.

---

## Mid game plan vs Anivia (how you actually carry)

### 1) Stop trying to “out-waveclear” her
After 6, she clears. Accept it.

Your job becomes:
- catch wave safely
- push when you can
- **disappear into fog**
- threaten picks/rotations

### 2) Fight on your terms (fog, flanks, late rotations)
Anivia is strongest when she is set up first with R + wall.

So you want:
- **picks** on people walking to objectives
- skirmishes where she can’t pre-place R in a choke
- flanks where you delete a carry before Anivia can layer zone control

### 3) Objective setup checklist (especially dragon)
- Push mid **45–60s** before spawn.
- Go dark with a control ward.
- If someone face-checks: punish. If they don’t: you’ve already won space.

## Common Naafiri mistakes in this matchup

- **Using W for movespeed, then eating Q stun.**  
  Fix: hold W for Q or the peel spell that stops you.
- **R into her while R is already down + Q is up.**  
  Fix: step out, reset angle, bait Q first.
- **All-in without an egg plan.**  
  Fix: track passive and have ignite/jungler or don’t commit.
- **Roaming without crashing.**  
  Fix: crash/bounce first, or you donate waves and plates to Anivia.

---

## Quick “in-game” checklist
Before you commit with R, answer:
1. **Is Anivia Q down or dodged?**
2. **Am I about to fight inside her R?** (if yes, why?)
3. **Do I kill egg?** (ignite/cooldowns/pack alive/teammate nearby)
4. **Where do I exit?** (E path, teammates, second R if available)

If you can’t answer these in your head: don’t press R yet.

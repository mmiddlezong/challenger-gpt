# Naafiri vs Swain (Mid) — Tempo Assassin Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (read this first)

### Your kit (Naafiri)
- **Q – Darkin Daggers:** 2-part dagger pattern. First hit applies a bleed; **second hit “pops”** remaining bleed for reliable closeout damage and **heals you** on champions/large monsters.
- **W – The Call of the Pack:** **1s untargetable on cast** + short **AD / movespeed** steroid + refresh/recall your pack.
- **E – Eviscerate:** short **dash** + AoE hit/explosion; **recalls packmates and heals them** (keeps your damage online).
- **R – Hounds’ Pursuit:** long-range **targeted champion-only commit** (can’t be body-blocked). Takedown soon after can grant a **recast**; second cast gives a **shield**.

### Swain’s “must respect” buttons
- **E – Nevermove (ROOT):** his **main CC**. If you get hit, he can **pull** you with passive and chain W/Q.
- **Passive – Ravenous Flock (PULL):** if you’re immobilized (often by his E), he can **yank you** (bad under tower / into his team).
- **W – Vision of Empire (SLOW + reveal):** long-range **slow** that helps him land E or keep you in R.
- **R – Demonic Ascension → Demonflare:** huge **drain-tank ultimate** that punishes extended melee fights; Demonflare can finish you if you commit poorly.

**Matchup rule:**  
If you dodge only one spell, **dodge Swain E**. If you take only one item adaptation, **buy anti-heal**.

## What this matchup really is

Swain is a **durable battlemage** with CC, sustain, and strong 5v5 presence. You are a **tempo assassin**.

You win this matchup less by “solo-killing Swain on repeat” and more by:
- staying healthy early,
- creating **crash → choice** tempo windows,
- roaming / pairing with your jungler,
- converting advantages into **plates + mid tower**,
- then deleting **side-laners and carries from fog**.

Swain wants you to:
- take extended trades,
- fight inside his R,
- over-commit with your champion-only R while his E is up.

Don’t.

## Pre-game setup (practical)

### Summoners
- **Ignite** most games: reduces Swain’s healing and makes your bursts actually stick.
- **Teleport** only if your plan is “stable lane → macro” and you trust yourself not to get chunked early.

### Start item
- **Doran’s Shield** (recommended): safest vs Swain poke + sustain; helps you reach level 6 with good HP.
- **Doran’s Blade**: only if you’re confident dodging E consistently and want more kill pressure.

### First buys (priority)
1. **Boots** early (dodging E is everything).
2. **Serrated Dirk** for kill/roam threat.
3. **Executioner’s Calling** (anti-heal) if Swain is even remotely hard to burst once he has R.

### Core item notes vs Swain
- **Anti-heal is not optional** once Swain has R or any sustain items.
- **Edge of Night** is excellent if their comp is skillshot-heavy; the spell shield can block **E** (but don’t rely on it—still dodge).
- **Maw / Hexdrinker** is strong if Swain (or enemy AP threats) are ahead.
- **Boots choice:**
  - **Ionian** if you’re snowballing and their CC is low.
  - **Mercury’s** if Swain + team have meaningful CC and you’re getting pinned.

### Rune options (pick one plan)
**Plan A: Lane stability + consistent kill windows**
- Electrocute + standard assassin tree
- Secondary: Resolve (Second Wind + tenacity option) for poke + CC resilience

**Plan B: Economy tempo**
- First Strike if you can reliably avoid getting tagged (harder vs Swain W/E)
- Secondary: Resolve for sustain

If you’re unsure: **Electrocute + Doran’s Shield + early boots** is the most consistent into Swain.

## Lane plan (levels 1–5): “Don’t lose HP for no reason”

### Your #1 job early
Arrive to level 3–5 **healthy enough** to threaten a crash/tempo window.  
You don’t need to “win wave 1.” You need to win your **first good crash**.

### Positioning fundamentals vs Swain E
- **Do not stand in predictable straight lines** when last-hitting.
- Minions do **not** “save you” from his E the way they do vs many skillshots.
- Last-hit, then immediately **sidestep** (make E timing hard).
- Early boots make your whole lane 10x easier.

### Trading (keep it short)
Your default trade pattern is:
- **Q poke + heal** (stay stable)
- **walk out**
- **Q pop** when it’s safe

**Do NOT**:
- dash in “for fun” while his E is available,
- take extended melee trades where he can Q you repeatedly,
- fight in his R expecting to out-sustain him.

## First 6 waves: concrete lane scripts

These are “templates.” Adjust if junglers show, you get chunked, or a wave state is already broken.

### Script 1 (most common): “Let him push → stabilize → crash cannon → reset”
**Wave 1**
- Start **Q**.
- Mostly last-hit. Keep HP high. Don’t trade into his full kit.

**Wave 2**
- Keep the wave near your side.
- If he walks up to Q the wave, tag him with Q when safe, then step out.

**Wave 3 (you hit level 3)**
- You now have Q/W/E. This is your first “real” defensive toolkit.
- Hold **E** primarily to dodge/escape, not to start trades.
- Hold **W** for a dodge window if you’re about to be hit by the spell that matters.

**Wave 4**
- If you’re healthy: start thinning so you can build a slow push.
- If you’re not healthy: keep the wave controlled near your side and farm.

**Wave 5 (cannon)**
- Aim to **crash** a bigger wave into tower.
- On crash, **reset** (most consistent) or ward/roam (only if it’s high certainty).

**Wave 6**
- Return with tempo and items. Now you can repeat the “crash → choice” loop.

### Script 2 (if Swain plays too far up): “Freeze → punish E cooldown → jungler help”
If Swain is pushing mindlessly and your jungler can path mid:
- Hold a **freeze** near your tower.
- Call for a gank when his E is down or he is overextended.
- Your job is to **not die** and to make him play scared of the river.

## Level 6+ kill windows: when you actually commit

Naafiri R is a **champion-only commitment**. Before you press it, you must know the next 10 seconds.

### “Green light” kill windows vs Swain
Commit (R) when at least one is true:
- Swain **missed E** (or used it on wave) and you can punish immediately.
- Swain is **already chunked** (≈60% or lower) and you can burst through before R sustain matters.
- You have **jungler nearby** for a 2v2/2v1, or you’re collapsing on him with numbers.
- Swain’s **R is down**, or you can force it and disengage cleanly.

### “Red light” situations (don’t R)
- Swain has **E up**, your W is down, and you’re about to face-check him.
- You’re committing **under his tower** where passive pull ruins you.
- Swain has R + stopwatch/Zhonya and your team is not in range to follow.
- You’re low HP and trying to “outplay” his drain.

### How to use W in the all-in
Treat **W** as:
- a **dodge window** (to avoid E root / key CC),
- a **pre-commit buff** (AD + movespeed),
- a **pack recall** (make sure your damage is actually present when you R).

**If you W just for speed and eat E**, you will lose the trade.

## Swain R management: the most important decision in the matchup

When Swain presses R, you have two options:

### Option A (best): Disengage, then re-enter
- **E out** / kite away
- Use terrain and spacing
- Wait out the “I will heal forever” phase
- Re-enter only if he’s now low and you can finish with Q pop + Ignite

### Option B (rare): Burst through it
Only do this if:
- he’s already low,
- you have Ignite,
- you have full pack online,
- and you’re not about to get rooted + pulled.

If you’re unsure, **choose Option A**. Swain wins extended fights by design.

## Crash-and-choose: how you “carry” this lane

Every time you crash a wave, choose **one**:

1. **Reset** (most consistent): buy, heal, return with tempo.
2. **Ward + track jungler** (protect your next push).
3. **Roam** (only if it’s <20 seconds to a clear decision point).
4. **Plate** (only if you’ve seen the enemy jungler and you’re safe).

**Assassin mid rule:**  
Roam only after a crash (or a guaranteed bounce). Don’t donate 2 waves to “maybe” help bot.

---

## Roaming vs Swain: where you get your real value

Swain is comfortable sitting mid and scaling into 5v5. Your job is to make the map unsafe.

### Best roam windows
- After a **crash** when Swain is stuck catching a wave under tower.
- When Swain used **E/W** and can’t contest your movement.
- When your jungler is ready for a **2v2** at raptors/river or a side collapse.

### Best roam targets
- **Bot lane** (most consistent squishies + CC follow-up)
- **Enemy jungle entrances** (picks on rotations)
- **Side lane waves** where someone is catching alone

Remember: you don’t have to kill Swain to win. You have to make **someone** die.

---

## Mid game plan: stop living mid

Once plates start falling:
- **Catch mid wave**
- **Push it**
- **Disappear**

Your best mid games look like:
- one clean roam / pick,
- convert to plates/objectives,
- then **delete carries from fog** and end through objective setups.

### Objective setups (your playground)
For dragon/herald/baron:
- Be there **45–60 seconds early**
- Push mid first
- Then go dark in river/jungle with a control ward
- Let someone face-check → you kill them → free objective

If you’re still showing mid when the objective spawns, you’re doing the assassin job backwards.

## Teamfights vs Swain: don’t play his game

Swain wants a front-to-back brawl inside his R.

You want:
- flank,
- pick,
- cleanup.

### How you should enter fights
1. Approach from **side/fog**.
2. Identify the spell that stops you (often **Swain E**, plus enemy support CC).
3. **Hold W** for that spell.
4. **R the carry** when they’re exposed—NOT Swain in the middle of his team.
5. Get your takedown → use recast/shield window to reposition or exit.

### If you must hit Swain
- Hit him **after** you’ve already removed a carry, or when he’s isolated.
- Do not stay inside his R with no exit plan.
- Refill packmates (W/E) before committing—Swain AoE can wipe your pack in extended fights.

## Common Naafiri mistakes vs Swain (and the fix)

### Mistake: “I R in while his E is up”
**Fix:** punish **missed E**, not “available E.” Make him miss, then go.

### Mistake: “I fight inside Swain R because I’m ahead”
**Fix:** ahead or not, Swain’s R is designed to punish melee uptime. Burst or disengage—don’t handshake.

### Mistake: “I don’t buy anti-heal”
**Fix:** Executioner’s is a tempo item here. It turns “almost kill” into “kill.”

### Mistake: “I use W for speed and get rooted”
**Fix:** W is your **anti-CC timing tool** first. Movespeed second.

### Mistake: “I fight when my pack is dead”
**Fix:** stall 2–3 seconds, W/E to refresh/recall packmates, then commit.

---

## Quick in-game checklist (use every wave crash)

1. **Where is enemy jungler likely?** (last seen + lane states)
2. **Did Swain just use E?** (if yes, you can posture aggressively)
3. **Do I have a 70%+ roam?** (setup + wave + vision)
4. If not: **ward or reset**
5. After a kill/forced recall: **plate / tower / objective / invade**, not “wander mid.”

## Mini practice plan (5 games)

### Goal 1: E dodge discipline
- Every time you last-hit, add a sidestep.
- Track in review: how many times did Swain E hit you in lane?

### Goal 2: Crash-and-choose
- No standing mid after a crash.
- If you can’t name a play: **reset**.

### Goal 3: R discipline
- Only R when:
  - E is down/missed, OR
  - target is isolated, OR
  - you have follow-up.
- Review every death after R: was it predictable?

---

## One-sentence game plan
**Stay healthy, dodge E, crash waves to earn tempo, roam for guaranteed picks, convert to towers/objectives, and never take extended fights inside Swain R.**

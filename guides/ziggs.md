# Naafiri vs Ziggs (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell cheat sheet (very concise — what to respect)
### Ziggs (things that stop or punish your commit)
- **Q (Bouncing Bomb)**: main poke + waveclear. If you eat 2–3 Qs, you lose your all-in threat.
- **W (Satchel Charge)**: **knockback/displacement** + peel. This is Ziggs’ best “get off me” tool and can ruin your engage or shove you into danger.
- **E (Hexplosive Minefield)**: **slow zone** that makes your pathing/exit awful; don’t dash through it unless you’re finishing a kill.
- **R (Mega Inferno Bomb)**: long-range AoE finisher. Respect when you’re low after committing.

### Naafiri (your key buttons in this matchup)
- **Q (Darkin Daggers)**: safe last-hit + poke + sustain; your tool to stay healthy and keep lane stable.
- **W (The Call of the Pack)**: **1s untargetable** — your “dodge the one spell that matters” button (usually Ziggs W, sometimes R/Q in the all-in).
- **E (Eviscerate)**: dash for reposition/finish; try not to open with it unless Ziggs already used W.
- **R (Hounds’ Pursuit)**: targeted champion-only commit. Use it when Ziggs’ peel is down, he’s isolated, or you have follow-up.

## Your win condition vs Ziggs
You’re not trying to out-CS him in a shove war. You win by:
1) **Staying healthy early**,  
2) **Creating one clean kill/forced recall**, then  
3) **Converting to plates / mid tower**, and  
4) **Roaming + fog picks** while Ziggs hates moving into unwarded river/jungle.

If Ziggs gets to perma-shove safely and you never threaten him, he’ll own the map with poke + tower pressure. Your job is to make him *afraid* to step up or rotate without vision.

## Lane plan by phases

## Levels 1–3: “Don’t lose HP for free”
**Goal:** arrive to level 3 with high HP and a playable wave.

- **Default stance:** slightly back, last-hit with **Q** whenever possible.
- **Don’t tank poke to auto once.** Ziggs wants you at 50% HP so you can’t all-in later.
- If he’s hard poking, **let the wave come slightly toward you**. A safer lane state beats “ego prio.”

**Micro rules**
- If Ziggs holds his W, assume you **cannot** commit.
- If you get chunked early: stop trading, farm with Q, and plan a clean reset.

## Levels 3–5: “Create a crash → earn a choice”
Your first real consistency spike is a **clean crash**.

When you crash a wave, you must choose one:
1) **Ward/track** (best vs gank setups),
2) **Reset** (most consistent),
3) **Short roam** (only with a real setup),
4) **Plate** (only if you’re confident enemy jungler can’t punish).

**Roam rule (strict)**
- Roam only if you **crashed** (or are about to crash) and your roam decision point is **<20 seconds**.
- If the roam is a guess, **don’t go**. Ziggs will take your wave and your plate.

---

## Level 6: “Punish positioning errors”
Now you can turn small Ziggs mistakes into:
**R commit → kill/force recall → plate(s) → dragon setup**

**A real kill window looks like**
- Ziggs **used W** (peel gone) **or**
- Ziggs is **past river** with no jungle cover **or**
- Ziggs is **low enough** that your burst is guaranteed **or**
- You have **jungle/CC follow-up** so he can’t simply W away.

**Not a real kill window**
- “He might miss everything.”
- “I’ll dive through W + E minefield and hope.”
- “I’m bored, so I’ll R anyway.”

---

## Trading & all-in patterns (simple + consistent)

### The matchup is about one question:
**Can Ziggs peel your commit with W?**

#### Pattern A — “Soft trade to earn space”
Use when Ziggs is healthy and holding cooldowns.
- **Q poke + heal** while farming
- Keep wave stable
- Look for moments where Ziggs uses Q on wave and can’t immediately punish you back

You’re building a lane where Ziggs can’t freely step up to harass without taking damage.

#### Pattern B — “Punish cooldown → real all-in”
Your best all-in is when Ziggs W is down.
- Walk up as if you might engage
- When he wastes **W** (or uses it on wave / randomly):
  - **W (untargetable timing)** to dodge his key response spell if needed
  - **R** to commit
  - **Q → Q pop** for reliable closeout
  - **E** to stick or dodge the last spell

**Important:** Don’t E forward early if W is still available. Open with patience; use E as *finish or dodge*, not as “hello.”

## Wave management: the Ziggs-specific version
Ziggs wants to:
- hard shove, poke under tower, and make you choose between CS and health.

You want to:
- keep a **manageable wave** that preserves HP and sets up your first crash/reset.

**Practical wave rules**
- If you’re getting poked: aim for a **slight freeze-ish** wave near your side. You’re safer and ganks are easier.
- If Ziggs over-shoves: let him push, farm, then **crash a stacked wave** when he has to last-hit under tower.
- Don’t “randomly shove” without a plan. If you shove, you must spend that tempo (ward/roam/reset/plate).

---

## Warding & jungle tracking (easy script)
Your job isn’t to out-vision the world — it’s to avoid dying while you’re trying to get tempo.

### Safe default wards
- **First ward:** one side of river (depending on where you’ll play) around your first crash window.
- **Control ward:** river brush or raptor/entrance area **when you plan to disappear**.

### When to ward (simple trigger)
- **Every time you crash**, ask: “Can I be ganked on my next two waves?”  
  If yes → ward. If no → reset or roam.

## Mid game: how you actually carry vs Ziggs
Ziggs is strongest when you’re visible mid and he can:
- poke you on waves
- take towers with pressure
- control objectives with long-range spells

So do the opposite:
1) **Catch mid wave → push → disappear**
2) Move into **fog** (river/jungle), sit on angles, and threaten picks
3) If nothing happens: **reset** or re-show safely on a wave
4) Show up to objectives **45–60s early**, push mid first, then go dark

**Key idea:** Ziggs hates walking into fog. If you’re off the map, he has to choose between “hit wave” and “die to a pick.”

---

## Fight plan vs Ziggs (don’t suicide)
You are not front-to-back DPS. You’re flank + cleanup.

**Your entry rules**
- Enter from side angles (river/jungle), not straight through mid.
- Identify the “stop spell”: **Ziggs W**.
- Hold **W** as your “dodge window” for that spell.
- Commit with **R** when Ziggs is exposed or after he uses W.

**Targeting**
- If Ziggs is hard to reach safely, don’t tunnel him. Kill the person who face-checks / rotates late / clears a side wave alone.

## First 6 waves: a concrete lane script (use this every game)
**Wave 1–2**
- Prioritize HP. Last-hit with Q, avoid eating free Qs.
- Let wave sit slightly toward you if he’s poking aggressively.

**Wave 3**
- With E unlocked, you can threaten short trades, but don’t E in first.
- Look for Q poke that also heals you. Keep your health high.

**Wave 4–5**
- Aim for your first **clean crash**.
- If you crash: choose **ward or reset** by default.

**Wave 6 (approaching level 6 soon)**
- Start “fake pressure” walks forward to bait Ziggs W.
- If Ziggs wastes W: you now have a real kill threat soon.

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)
- **Mistake:** You E forward and Ziggs W knocks you away → you lose tempo and HP.  
  **Fix:** Save E unless W is down or you’re finishing the kill.

- **Mistake:** You roam on a slow-push away from you and lose two waves + plate.  
  **Fix:** Roam only on crash/bounce. Otherwise reset.

- **Mistake:** You R into minefield + peel and die.  
  **Fix:** R is a plan, not a vibe. Know your entry angle and your exit (E, second R, terrain, teammates).

- **Mistake:** You keep showing mid as dragon spawns.  
  **Fix:** Push mid early, then go dark and hunt the face-check.

---

## Quick checklist (use in-game)
After every crash, ask:
1) **Where is enemy jungler likely?**
2) **Is there a 70%+ play?** (roam with setup / invade with jungler / objective setup)
3) If not, **ward or reset**.
4) Don’t spend **R** unless you can answer: “What happens in the next 10 seconds?”

## The one sentence matchup summary
**Stay healthy, bait or track Ziggs W, commit only on real windows, and turn your first advantage into plates/mid tower — then win the map through fog picks while Ziggs hates rotating.**

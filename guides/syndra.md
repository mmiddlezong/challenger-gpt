# Naafiri vs Syndra (Mid) — Matchup Guide

> **Matchup theme:** Syndra wins by controlling space with **spheres + E stun** and chunking you out before you can commit.  
> You win by staying healthy, managing the wave for **safe crashes / freezes**, and only hard-committing when **E is down** or your angle makes her E unreliable.

## Syndra spell cheat sheet (what you MUST respect)

**Q — Dark Sphere**  
- Creates a sphere on the ground (her whole kit is built around these).  
- **What to avoid:** standing in predictable lines where a sphere can be pushed through you with **E**.  
- **Tell:** you’ll see spheres placed slightly off to your side or behind your minions to create stun angles.

**W — Force of Will**  
- Picks up a minion or a sphere and throws it, dealing damage and **slowing**.  
- **What to avoid:** getting hit by W slow when you’re trying to disengage (it often sets up Q/E or an easy R range).

**E — Scatter the Weak (THE BIG ONE)**  
- Cone knockback. If it pushes a **sphere** through you, you get **STUNNED (hard CC)**.  
- **What to avoid:** the classic **Q → E (“QE”)** long-range stun, or **W-sphere → E** surprise stun angle.  
- **Rule:** if you get stunned, assume you lose the trade and might die if jungle is nearby.

**R — Unleashed Power**  
- Point-and-click burst using her spheres.  
- **What to avoid:** committing while already chunked (especially under ~70% HP) or when you can’t finish quickly.

**Passive upgrades (Splinters)**  
- Her abilities gain extra effects as she stacks Splinters (notably E becomes more forgiving/wider later).  
- **What to avoid:** treating late-game Syndra like “the same lane bully.” Her pick threat increases.

## Your win conditions in this matchup

1. **Dodge/deny E stuns** → you stay in lane, keep XP, and can actually threaten her.
2. **Wave control** (freeze near you or crash on your terms) → enables ganks/roams without bleeding plates.
3. **Kill windows after E is used** or when she’s forced to spend spells on the wave → you punish her immobility.
4. **Mid-game flanks/picks**: Syndra hates being approached from fog on a side angle—she prefers front-to-back spacing.

## Lane plan by levels

### Levels 1–2: “HP > ego”
**Goal:** reach level 3 with high HP and a sane wave state.

- Last-hit safely. Use Q mainly for farm + light poke when she steps up.
- Don’t take auto + Q trades for free. If she’s hitting you while you’re last-hitting, you’re “paying HP as rent.”
- Respect early spheres: if she places Q near the side of the wave, she’s often setting up a future QE line.

**Micro rule:** move *sideways* (perpendicular) after she casts Q, not straight back. Straight back keeps you in line for E.

---

### Levels 3–5: “Earn a crash or hold a freeze”
Now you decide the lane’s shape.

#### Option A — Defensive freeze (best vs strong Syndra)
**Goal:** keep the wave slightly on your side so she must step up.

- Hold 3–4 enemy caster minions alive (classic freeze) and thin with Q as needed.
- Ping your jungler *before* the wave is perfectly frozen. You want time for them to path mid.
- If she walks up to break the freeze, she’s exposed (no dash).

#### Option B — Planned crash (for recall/roam timing)
**Goal:** build a wave, crash it, then **choose** (ward / roam / reset).

- Slow push 1–2 waves, then hard push to crash.
- The moment it crashes, you **must** do something:  
  - ward raptors/river,  
  - roam (only if it’s fast and likely), or  
  - reset.

**Do not:** crash a wave and stand mid indecisively. Syndra loves getting free resets of her own.

---

### Level 6+: “Commit with rules”
Once you have R, you can punish her if she missteps—but only if you’re disciplined.

**Green lights to all-in:**
- **E is down** (used on wave, missed, or forced early).
- She is **past river** without vision/jungle backup.
- She is already **chunked** from Q poke and can’t survive your burst.
- You have an angle that makes QE hard (flank/side approach).

**Red lights (don’t R):**
- She’s holding E and you’re walking straight at her.
- You’re low enough that her R will just delete you on entry.
- Enemy jungler is missing and your wave is pushing away from you.

## How to dodge the stun consistently (the matchup skill test)

Syndra stuns you when **a sphere travels through you** due to E.

**Your positioning rules:**
- Treat every sphere as a potential “stun rail.” Don’t stand on the rail.
- Don’t kite backward in a straight line from Syndra when there’s a sphere between you.
- If she places Q slightly to your left/right, immediately drift the *other* direction to break the line.

**Your movement rule:**  
When you expect QE, do a short “stutter” (micro-step in, then hard sidestep).  
This baits E without giving her the straight-line stun.

## Trading windows (when you’re allowed to play the game)

### Window 1: E used / missed
This is the biggest window. After E is down:
- step up for Q poke that also sustains you
- threaten a heavier trade (E dash forward + Q) if she can’t peel

### Window 2: W used to farm
If she uses W on the wave, her “burst + slow” is down.  
She can still E, so you’re not fully safe, but it’s easier to pressure.

### Window 3: She must last-hit cannon / melee cluster
Syndra players often telegraph their Q to secure multiple minions.  
Use those moments to land Q and then back off before she lines up QE.

## Naafiri commit pattern (simple, repeatable)

**Pre-check (do this before you press R):**
- Where is enemy jungler likely?
- Is Syndra’s E available?
- If I don’t kill instantly, how do I leave?

**Basic approach options:**

### Option A: “Hold W to dodge E”
- Walk in threatening range.
- The moment you see E (or the setup is obvious), **W** to dodge it, then commit.

### Option B: “W pre-buff to force panic E”
- If you’re already in a good angle and want to force her hand: pop W to speed up + create threat.
- If she panic E’s and misses, you commit.

**During the all-in:**
- Don’t eat W slow on the way out. If you’re disengaging, path away from her W landing area.
- Use your E to reposition *around* spheres, not through obvious lines.

---

## Jungler interaction (how to make Syndra miserable)

Syndra has no dash; she relies on E to disengage.

**Best gank setup:**
- Freeze near your side.
- Ping your jungler and *delay your engage* until they’re close.
- Try to bait her E first (fake step-up, then sidestep).

**Important detail:**  
Tell your jungler to approach from an angle that doesn’t line both of you up for one QE stun.

---

## Roaming vs Syndra (discipline rules)

Syndra can punish bad roams by taking plates and tempo.

**Roam only when:**
- you’ve crashed a wave, and
- the roam is fast + has clear setup (ally CC, enemy pushed, no summoners)

**If you can’t roam:** ward or reset.  
A “nothing roam” vs Syndra is extra punishing because she clears waves well and will take your tower HP.

---

## Mid game & teamfights (how you carry into Syndra)

Syndra’s job later is to **pick** or **one-shot** from fog with stun setup.

**Your job:**
- Don’t ARAM mid into her spheres.
- Push a side wave, then disappear into fog for a flank.
- In objective fights, wait until she uses E on frontline or throws it defensively.
- If you can’t reach her safely, kill her ADC/support instead—Syndra hates losing her backline partner.

**Common winning pattern:**
- Mid wave shoved → you disappear → someone face-checks for vision → you delete them → objective.

---

## Common mistakes (and what to do instead)

**Mistake:** R straight at her while E is up  
✅ **Fix:** pressure first, bait E, then commit.

**Mistake:** taking repeated Q+auto poke while farming  
✅ **Fix:** give up 1–2 CS early rather than losing 200 HP. You need health to threaten level 6.

**Mistake:** roaming without a crash  
✅ **Fix:** crash → roam/reset. Never roam on a wave pushing away from you.

**Mistake:** fighting inside a pile of spheres  
✅ **Fix:** use E reposition to fight *around* them; reset the angle.

## Learning objectives (use these to focus games)

### Objective 1 — “No free stuns”
**Goal:** get stunned by a sphere **≤ 2 times** in lane phase.  
**Review after game:** each stun—was it a straight-line retreat? Were you standing on a sphere rail?

### Objective 2 — “Wave control checkpoint”
By **6:00**, you should have achieved **one** of:
- a freeze near your side for a gank attempt, or
- a clean crash into a reset

If neither happened, you likely let Syndra dictate the lane.

### Objective 3 — “R discipline”
**Rule for 10 games:** do not press R unless:
- E is down, **or**
- you are flanking from a side angle where QE is unreliable.

Track: how many R deaths were “predictable”?

### Objective 4 — “Crash-and-choose”
Every crash must lead to a choice: **ward / roam / reset** (no standing mid).  
Aim for **2+ clean resets** before 14 minutes.

## Quick in-game reminders (sticky-note version)

- **E stun is the matchup.** If you dodge E, you can play.  
- **Sidestep after Q.** Don’t retreat in a straight line.  
- **Freeze or crash on purpose.** No random wave states.  
- **All-in after E.** Otherwise you’re flipping.  
- **Roam only on crash.** Syndra will punish bad roams hard.

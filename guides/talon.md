# Naafiri vs Talon (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spell quick sheet (what to track / what to avoid)

### Talon (your lane threats)
- **Passive — Blade’s End:** Talon’s abilities apply **Wound stacks (up to 3)**. If he **autos you at 3 stacks**, you take a **heavy bleed**.  
  **Avoid:** letting him tag you with **W + Q** and then auto for the 3rd stack. (Back off when you’re at 2 stacks.)
- **Q — Noxian Diplomacy:** **Targeted stab**. If you’re out of melee range, he **leaps to you**. This is his main “finish” button.
- **W — Rake:** Two-part daggers (out + back). The **return hit deals bonus damage and SLOWS**.  
  **This slow is Talon’s main CC** and it often enables his full burst + passive proc.  
  **Avoid:** getting hit by **both** passes, especially the **return**.
- **E — Assassin’s Path:** Wall-hop for **insane roam speed** and escape angles.  
  **Avoid:** “matching” roams late through fog—he’ll arrive first and you’ll lose lane.
- **R — Shadow Assault:** Stealth/invisibility + blades. Big burst when blades move and converge.  
  **Avoid:** eating his “exit stealth” burst while you’re already wounded/low.

### Naafiri (your answers)
- **Q — Darkin Daggers:** poke + sustain + “pop” execute vs bleeding targets.
- **W — The Call of the Pack:** **1s untargetable on cast** (your best outplay button). Also gives a short buff + refreshes pack pressure.  
  **Use W to dodge:** Talon **Q**, the **W return slow**, and/or the key moment of his **R burst**.
- **E — Eviscerate:** short dash to reposition (dodge daggers / exit his all-in) + helps wave control.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit:** **champion-only targeted commit** (not blockable) with takedown-based recast/shield (post-midscope).  
  **Rule:** don’t R first into uncertainty—use it when Talon can’t instantly burst you back or escape cleanly.

## Matchup identity (how this lane is actually decided)
This lane is **tempo assassin vs tempo assassin**, but Talon’s **E** gives him the better *raw* roam speed. Your win comes from:
1) **Not donating early deaths**,  
2) **Denying (or punishing) his roam timers with wave state**, and  
3) **Using W untargetability to break his “stack → proc passive” pattern.**

If you play the wave well, Talon is forced into bad choices:
- roam and lose a wave/plates, or
- stay and risk getting out-traded once his W/Q windows are tracked.

---

## Runes + summoners (matchup-focused)
**Summoners:** Flash + Ignite is standard for kill pressure. If you’re learning the matchup or enemy jungle is high threat, Flash + **Barrier** can be a consistency pick.

**Runes (general):**
- Choose an **explosive keystone** (burst trades) and consider **defensive secondary** if you’re getting bullied early.
- If Talon is consistently chunking you with W, prioritize **sustain/mitigation** runes (and don’t greed damage-only setups).

> Items/runes shift patch-to-patch; the rest of this guide (wave, windows, fight patterns) stays useful.

---

## Skill order (early lane)
**Level 1:** Q  
**Level 2:** W (you want the untargetable before Talon’s first real all-in)  
**Level 3:** E  
Then: **max Q** first.

---

## The first 6 waves (lane script you can actually follow)

### Wave 1 (level 1): “Don’t eat free W damage”
- Start **Q**, last hit safely.
- Talon often opens **W** to push + poke. Stand **off-center** from the wave so he can’t clip you with **both** the outward and return blades.
- If he uses W on the wave, you can **Q the wave + lightly tag him** *only if* you don’t take a return blade for it.

**Goal:** reach level 2 with HP and potions intact.

### Wave 2 (level 2): “Respect the first all-in attempt”
- Take **W**.
- Your rule: **If you’re at 2 Wound stacks, back off.** Don’t let him auto for the passive bleed.
- If Talon uses **Q on a minion** to last hit, he has less threat for a few seconds—use that window for **Q poke** and better last hits.

**Goal:** keep wave in a state where he can’t roam for free (see wave plans below).

### Wave 3 (level 3): “Now you can dodge + disengage”
- Take **E**.
- You now have two defensive tools:
  - **W** (untargetable) to deny his targeted/commit moment
  - **E** (dash) to dodge the **W return** or disengage his Q trade

**Default stance:** hold W. Don’t burn it “for speed” unless you see their jungler and Talon can’t punish you.

### Wave 4–5: “Decide your wave plan (freeze or crash)”
Pick **one** based on how the game looks:

#### Plan A — Freeze to punish roams (most consistent)
Do this when:
- you don’t know where enemy jungle is, or
- Talon is looking to roam constantly, or
- you’re slightly behind.

How:
- Let Talon push with W.
- Hold the wave **just outside your tower**.
- If he roams anyway, he **drops a full wave**. You hard shove only when you’re sure you can take **plate(s)** or reset.

#### Plan B — Crash to get first move (when you have control)
Do this when:
- enemy jungle is visible or you have strong vision,
- you’re healthy,
- and Talon can’t kill you on the next 10 seconds.

How:
- Thin with **Q** (and **E** if safe).
- Crash a bigger wave.
- Use the crash for **ward / reset / invade with jungler**. Don’t stand mid doing nothing.

### Wave 6 timing: “The lane changes at 6”
At level 6:
- Talon gains kill threat with **R**, but it’s also his main escape.
- You gain reliable **R commit**.

**Your best 6+ plan:** force Talon to spend something first (W, R, or ignite timing), then commit with your R when you can survive the burst with **W + E**.

---

## Trading patterns (what to do in the actual fights)

### 1) The “anti-Talon” rule: break his passive proc
Talon’s dream trade is: **W (tag) → Q → auto (proc bleed) → back off / finish**.  
Your job is to interrupt that sequence.

**If he Q’s in:**  
- **W right before Q lands** (or as he commits) to make his targeted burst fizzle / miss timing.  
- If W is down, use **E** to dodge the **W return** and disengage before he autos at 3 stacks.

### 2) Short trade (safe, repeatable)
- **Q** him when he steps up to last hit.
- Back up so he can’t Q-leap freely.
- If he chases with Q: **W** to deny the key damage moment, then retreat with **E** angle.

You win this matchup by stacking many “good” short trades, not by flipping one all-in at level 3.

### 3) All-in (only when conditions are met)
All-in when at least **one** is true:
- Talon’s **W is down** (no slow setup),
- Talon already used **R** (escape gone),
- Talon is overextended and you have jungler nearby.

Execution idea:
- Hold **W** for the moment his burst would land.
- **R** when you’re confident you won’t get instantly bled out.
- Use **E** either to dodge return blades or to stick if he flashes away.

**Don’t:** chase him through multiple walls. That’s playing his champion, not yours.

## Roam management (the matchup’s real win condition)
Talon’s E means: if he gets a clean shove, he can be bot/top **fast**.

### Your rules vs Talon roams
- **Ping early** (the moment he leaves vision). Waiting 3 seconds is often too late.
- **Do not follow through fog and walls** unless you have a safe, fast route and the play is guaranteed.
- If you can’t match in time: **shove hard → plate → reset / ward**.

### Best wards vs Talon (simple)
- **Raptor entrance / jungle corridor** on the side Talon wants to roam toward (shows him leaving lane).
- **Pixel brush** when you’re worried about ganks + river fights.
- Swap to **Control Wards** early if possible: Talon thrives when mid has no information.

---

## Mid game plan vs Talon
Talon will look for:
- flanks through walls,
- catching side waves,
- picking your backline in rotations.

You carry by:
- pushing a wave,
- disappearing into fog first,
- and threatening picks around objectives before he gets angles.

**Objective setup tip:** ward the **walls behind** your team (Talon’s entry points), not only the river brush.

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)
- **Mistake:** you eat the W return slow “because it only hit once.”  
  **Fix:** treat the **return** as the real spell. If you dodge only one part, dodge the return.
- **Mistake:** you R first and Talon R’s/Es out, then you’re stuck.  
  **Fix:** force a cooldown first, or only R when you have a guaranteed finish.
- **Mistake:** you follow Talon late and lose lane + the fight.  
  **Fix:** either match instantly **on the shove**, or punish with plates and vision.

---

## Quick checklist (use every game)
- Did I avoid getting hit by **both** parts of Talon W (especially the **return slow**)?
- Did I back off when I had **2 Wound stacks**?
- Did I hold **W** to deny Talon Q/R burst instead of using it casually?
- When Talon roamed: did I **ping instantly** and **punish with wave + plates**?

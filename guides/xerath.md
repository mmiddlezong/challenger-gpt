# Naafiri Mid vs Xerath — Matchup Guide

## Xerath spell cheat sheet (what to avoid)
- **Passive — Mana Surge:** Xerath regains mana when he autos. **Punish him when he walks up to auto** (that’s his only “melee-range” moment).
- **Q — Arcanopulse:** Long-range line nuke after a brief charge. **Main poke + waveclear.** It goes through minions, so “hiding in the wave” doesn’t fully protect you.
- **W — Eye of Destruction:** Large AoE with a **stronger center** that applies a **slow**.  
  - **Avoid the center** (it makes his Q/E/R much easier to land).
- **E — Shocking Orb:** Skillshot that **stuns** the first unit hit (minions, packmates, you). **This is the spell you play around.**  
  - Stun gets longer the farther it travels.  
  - **If you get hit by E, expect: W slow → Q → maybe R shots → you lose lane.**
- **R — Rite of the Arcane:** Long-range artillery shots (multiple casts) used to **finish low HP targets** or influence fights from afar.  
  - **Never sit at low HP without a plan** (recall, reset, or you will get ulted).

**Your #1 rule:** Don’t lose the matchup to random poke. Xerath wins when you’re forced to lane at 40–60% HP and can’t ever threaten an all-in.

## Matchup identity
**Xerath’s win plan**
- Perma-poke, perma-shove, chip plates while staying out of reach.
- Hold **E** to deny your engage.
- Use **R** to punish low HP or impact side fights while you’re stuck clearing waves.

**Naafiri’s win plan**
- Stay healthy through early waves, then create **one clean window**:
  - Xerath misses **E**, or
  - Xerath uses Q/W on the wave and you can punish, or
  - You set up a gank/fight with your jungler off a freeze.
- Convert any advantage into **plates/tower** and then **play fog** (Xerath hates moving into darkness).

**How you consistently “win” this lane:**  
Not by forcing solo kills every game. You win by building **tempo** (good crashes + good recalls), denying his poke value, and turning missed E into either a kill or a forced reset.

## Lane goals & mental checklist
### Primary goals (in order)
1. **HP preservation** (you can’t threaten if you’re chunked)
2. **Wave control** (freeze when possible, crash intentionally when you want to move/reset)
3. **Punish E cooldown** (that’s your real “green light”)
4. **Turn crashes into action** (ward / roam / reset)

### Quick checklist every wave
- Did Xerath’s **E** get used? If yes: **play aggressively for ~10–14s**.
- Is the wave pushing to me? If yes: **hold it**, call jungler, deny plates.
- Did I just crash a wave? If yes: **choose** (ward / roam / reset). Don’t loiter mid.

---

## Positioning fundamentals (the difference between easy and miserable)
### The “triangle” positioning
You want to satisfy three things at once:
- **Minions between you and Xerath** (to block E)
- **Not standing in a straight line with your wave** (so Q can’t hit wave + you)
- **Enough space to sidestep W center**

Practical habit:
- Stand **slightly to the side** of your caster minions, not directly behind them.
- When Xerath charges Q, **move perpendicular** (sideways), not backward in a straight line.
- When W is cast, **move out of center first** even if it means giving 1–2 CS. Your HP is worth more than a single minion.

---

## Wave plan: how to control the lane vs artillery
### Levels 1–2 (stabilize)
- Your job is to **not get chunked** before level 3.
- Last-hit safely. Trade only when Xerath walks up for passive autos or wastes Q/W on wave.
- If you’re being pressured: let the wave come toward you (don’t fight for early shove at the cost of HP).

### Levels 3–5 (freeze for ganks, crash for tempo)
**Default plan:** let Xerath push, then **hold a freeze-ish wave** on your side.
- Xerath is immobile and hates being extended.
- A shallow freeze forces him to step up to break it, which exposes him to ganks and all-ins.

**When to crash instead:**  
Crash when you want a **clean recall** or a **roam**.
- Only roam off a **real crash** (big wave into tower). Roaming off a half-wave lets Xerath instantly shove back and take plates.

### Level 6+ (your threat begins, but only if you’re healthy)
- You can kill Xerath if he’s missing E/Flash or mispositions.
- If you’re low HP, his **R** flips the lane: he doesn’t need to risk anything to win.

---

## Trading rules (simple, repeatable)
### Rule 1: Trade around E
**If Xerath E is up:** your job is to **threaten** without committing.
- Poke with Q.
- Walk up and down to bait E.
- Keep minions/packmates between you and him.

**If Xerath E is down:** you can **actually run at him**.
- Walk up, force space, threaten all-in or chunk.
- If you have a kill angle, commit with confidence. He has no real peel.

### Rule 2: Don’t “E forward” just to trade
Naafiri’s dash is valuable for:
- dodging the spell that matters (often E or W center)
- sticking once you commit  
If you dash forward without a plan, Xerath gets a free E/W/Q sequence and you lose the lane.

### Rule 3: Short trades > long trades until you’re ready to all-in
Early, your best trades are:
- **Q poke + back off**
- punish passive autos
- punish missed spells

Xerath wants you to stay in range long enough to eat multiple rotations. Don’t.

---

## All-in windows (how you actually kill Xerath)
### Your best “green lights”
- Xerath **misses E** (or uses it on a minion/packmate).
- Xerath uses **Q + W** to clear a wave and has nothing left to stop you.
- Xerath is past river with no vision and you have jungler nearby.

### Commitment discipline (very important)
When you commit with ultimate, you need one of:
- **E is down**, or
- **you can reliably dodge E** (with your untargetable timing), or
- he has **no Flash** and you’re coming from fog with distance already closed.

### Micro tips that matter
- Your packmates can **eat Xerath E** because it stuns the first unit hit. Keep them between you and Xerath when possible.
- If Xerath is holding E, don’t sprint at him in a straight line. Approach at an angle and force him to guess.

---

## Playing vs Xerath R (don’t donate deaths)
### Defensive rules
- **If you’re below ~40–50% HP and Xerath has R, your recall timer is part of the matchup.**
- If you must stay: break vision, stand near allies, and be ready to juke.

### Dodging pattern
- Move unpredictably (small stutter-steps).
- Save your biggest dodge tool for when he starts to “lead” shots (usually shot 2–4).
- If you have to choose: dodge first, CS later. Getting ulted to 10% HP ruins your next 2 minutes of tempo.

### Offensive punish
If Xerath ults from a position you can reach quickly (too close / no peel / bad angle), it’s often a **free punish**:
- He is effectively stationary while casting.
- If you arrive and he has no E, he dies or burns Flash.

---

## Jungle + vision plan (how you make Xerath hate life)
### Best setup: freeze near your tower
- Ping your jungler when the wave is held.
- Xerath has to walk up to break it, and he’s a sitting duck.

### What to ward
- If you’re being pushed in: ward to prevent dives and track the jungler’s approach route.
- If you’re crashing and moving: ward **river entrances** so you can roam safely and deny Xerath’s counter-roam angles.

### Coordination note
Tell your jungler one sentence:
> “If Xerath misses E, we can kill him.”

It makes ganks cleaner because everyone plays around the same cooldown.

---

## Mid game plan (where you start carrying)
### Don’t ARAM into Xerath for free
Xerath loves 5-man mid sieges. You don’t.

Your best mid game pattern:
1. Catch a wave safely.
2. Push it enough to force an answer.
3. Disappear into fog and threaten a pick/side collapse.

### How you win objectives vs Xerath
- Arrive early to objectives and sit in fog.
- Make the enemy support/ADC pay for face-checking.  
Xerath is strongest when your team walks into him through choke points with no vision.

### Side lane pressure
Xerath hates defending long lanes alone. If he shows to catch side waves:
- He’s vulnerable to all-in or collapse.
- He can’t safely hold vision alone.

---

## Teamfighting vs Xerath
### Your job
- You are not the frontline.
- You are the **flank + cleanup** threat.
- You want Xerath to waste E on someone else or miss it, then you go.

### Fight entry rules
- If Xerath E is up and you have no angle: **wait**.
- If you see E used (or you bait it): **go immediately**.
- Don’t run down mid through his poke. Come from the side.

---

## Common mistakes (and the fix)
- **Mistake:** Standing directly behind your caster minions (Q hits you + wave).  
  **Fix:** Stand slightly off to the side; make him choose wave or poke.
- **Mistake:** Dashing forward for “a trade.”  
  **Fix:** Hold dash for dodge/commit. Trade with Q.
- **Mistake:** Roaming off a bad wave state and losing 2 waves + plates.  
  **Fix:** Roam only after a real crash; otherwise reset/ward.
- **Mistake:** Staying low HP because “I can farm one more wave.”  
  **Fix:** Recall. Xerath R exists to punish this.
- **Mistake:** Forcing ultimate into E.  
  **Fix:** bait E first, or commit only with a real dodge/angle.

## Learning objectives (focus games)
Pick ONE block for 5–10 games. Track it.

### Block A — “Don’t get stunned”
- Objective: **≤1 Xerath E hit before 10 minutes**.
- Method: Always keep minions/packmates between you; sidestep when he’s fishing.

### Block B — “HP is your resource”
- Objective: Average **≥70% HP at minute 5** across games.
- Method: Give up 1–2 CS instead of eating W center + Q.

### Block C — “Punish E cooldown”
- Objective: Every time Xerath misses E, you force one of:
  - a chunk (he must potion),
  - a forced recall,
  - a kill/flash.
- Method: Immediately step up and take space after E is down.

### Block D — “Crash-and-choose”
- Objective: After each crash, you must do exactly ONE:
  - ward,
  - roam,
  - reset.
- Method: No standing mid indecisively.

### Block E — “Don’t donate to R”
- Objective: **0 deaths to Xerath R** where you were low HP and stayed anyway.
- Method: Respect your recall timers; don’t greed waves.

---

## Quick matchup cheat sheet (pasteable)
- **Play safe early:** preserve HP, don’t tank poke for CS.
- **Block E:** minions/packmates between you and Xerath.
- **Sidestep Q:** stand off-wave; move perpendicular.
- **Avoid W center:** it sets up everything.
- **Punish missed E:** that’s your all-in timer.
- **Roam only after crash:** otherwise you lose too much.
- **Don’t stay low HP:** Xerath R will punish you.

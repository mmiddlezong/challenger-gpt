# Naafiri vs Annie (Mid) — Matchup Guide

## Spells you must respect (read this first)

### Annie threat checklist (CC + burst)
- **Passive — Pyromania (STUN):** After **4 spell casts**, Annie’s **next offensive spell stuns**. **She starts the game with stun available**.  
  **If the stun is up, treat Annie like she has a loaded gun.** Do not commit with R unless you have a guaranteed dodge/exit.
- **Q — Disintegrate (point-and-click):** Primary **stun delivery** (with passive) and gank setup. **Targeted** → you cannot “minion block” it.
- **W — Incinerate (cone AOE):** Waveclear + burst. With passive, the cone **stuns**.
- **R — Summon: Tibbers (burst AOE):** Biggest kill threat. With passive, the drop **stuns in AOE**.  
  **Flash + (stun) + Tibbers** is Annie’s classic “you die” button.
- **E — Molten Shield (defensive + tempo):** Lets her tank your poke and helps her **stack stun quickly** (often used right before trading/all-in).

### Your answers (Naafiri)
- **W — The Call of the Pack (1s untargetable):** Your **single most important button** in this matchup.  
  **Hold W to dodge the stun spell** (stun-Q, stun-W, or Tibbers drop). Don’t waste it “just for movespeed”.
- **E — Eviscerate (dash):** Your reposition tool to **step out of Tibbers zone / cone angles** or to finish a kill after stun is down.
- **R — Hounds’ Pursuit (commit):** Great to punish Annie when **stun is down** or **flash/ult are down** — but it’s **high commitment** into point-and-click CC.

## Matchup identity (what you’re actually trying to do)

Annie is a **lockdown burst mage** designed to punish assassins who “go in first.”  
Naafiri is a **tempo assassin** who wins by **staying stable**, then turning **one clean window** into:
- kill pressure → plates/objective
- roams into bot/top
- picks from fog once lane breaks

**Your win condition is usually:**  
**don’t die to stun → get prio on safe waves → roam with jungler → convert.**

---

## Runes, sums, and starting items (simple + practical)

### Summoner spells
- **Default:** **Flash + Ignite** (kill pressure when Annie misuses stun).
- **If you keep dying to Flash-Tibbers or jungle + stun chains:** consider **Flash + Cleanse**.  
  Cleanse dramatically lowers Annie’s “one button” kill threat, but you lose Ignite tempo.

### Starting items
- **Doran’s Shield** if you expect to get poked/pressured early or you’re still learning the matchup.
- **Long Sword + Refillable** if you’re confident you can stay healthy and want earlier spike.

### Rune direction (don’t overthink it)
- **Burst/kill windows:** Electrocute-style page (burst + snowball).
- **Safer lane / anti-burst:** consider a secondary tree with **sustain/tenacity** (anything that helps you live through stun trades).

> Tip: In this matchup, “the best rune” is often the one that stops you from getting forced to recall at 40% HP.

## The one habit that decides the lane: track Annie stun

You should be glancing at Annie’s passive indicator **constantly**.

### If Annie stun is **UP**
- **You do not R in.**
- You last-hit safely (even if it costs you a few CS).
- You position so you can **W on reaction** if she walks up to stun-Q.

### If Annie stun is **DOWN**
- You can **walk up for Q trades**, threaten an all-in, or push for a tempo window.
- You can call your jungler to fight because Annie’s peel is weaker.

---

## Lane script (first 6 waves) — concrete and repeatable

> The goal is **high HP + stable wave + no stun death**, then you win through tempo.

### Wave 1 (levels 1–2): “Respect the starting stun”
- Annie begins lane with stun available.  
- **Start Q.** Last-hit safely; do not step into her Q range to “prove something.”
- Let the wave come slightly toward you if she’s pushing.

**Your job:** arrive to level 3 with HP.

### Wave 2: “Don’t get stunned for a melee minion”
- If she’s holding stun, expect **stun-Q** when you walk up.
- Only trade if:
  - her stun is down, or  
  - you can **W reactively** and still get out.

### Wave 3 (cannon wave): “Stabilize + set your first ward”
- This is when many junglers can start threatening mid.
- **If you are pushed:** ward **one side** (pixel brush / raptor entrance side) and play toward that side.
- **If the wave is on your side:** you can delay warding slightly, but be ready as soon as you need to step up.

**Rule:** if Annie has stun and you don’t know where the jungler is, you’re not allowed to be greedy.

### Wave 4: “Your first real tempo decision”
Pick **one** plan based on lane state:
- **A) Safe crash (best case):** thin wave with Q, crash, then **reset/ward/hover**.
- **B) Hold near your side (common):** keep wave closer to you to reduce stun-gank threat.
- **C) If she wastes stun on waveclear:** take a **short trade** (Q poke + Q pop), then back off.

### Wave 5: “Create a crash → earn a choice”
If you can get a clean crash, you earn a choice:
- **Ward deeper** (raptors / river entrance)
- **Roam with jungler**
- **Reset** for item/HP tempo

If you can’t crash safely, don’t force it. Annie + jungler + stun is how lanes end.

### Wave 6 (level 6 window): “Do not donate a Tibbers kill”
At level 6, the lane becomes binary:
- If Annie has **stun + R + Flash**, she can kill you from surprising angles.
- If Annie has **no stun** (or no R/Flash), she’s punishable.

**Your level 6 plan:**
- Track her stun.
- Keep your HP high.
- Look for a window where she **uses stun on wave** or shows she **can’t stun you on entry**.

---

## Trading rules (what to do, not just what to think)

### Your default trade pattern
- **Q poke** when she steps up for CS.
- Back off before she can return a full combo.
- If she’s bleeding, look for the **Q “pop”** to close the trade.

### When you’re allowed to take a bigger trade
You can use E aggressively **only if**:
- Annie stun is down **or**
- you can dodge the stun with W **and**
- you’re not walking into jungle pressure

### What you must NOT do
- **E forward** into Annie while her stun is ready.
- **R first** into Annie’s stun + Tibbers range.
- Stand at half HP “because it’s fine.” Annie loves half-HP targets.

## All-in rules (how you actually kill Annie)

### A “real” kill window looks like one of these
1. **Annie uses her stun** (on wave, on your jungler, or misses it).  
2. Annie’s **Flash is down** (she can’t create a surprise stun angle).  
3. Annie’s **R is down** (her burst threat is dramatically lower).  
4. You have **your jungler nearby** and can layer damage/CC.

### Simple all-in execution
- Wait for **stun down**.
- **W (hold the untargetable for her panic spell)**.
- **R commit** only when you’re confident she can’t instantly stun you.
- Use **E** either to:
  - dodge Tibbers/cone angle, or
  - finish after she flashes.

> If Annie still has stun, the “best combo” is usually **don’t go**.

## Jungle + vision plan (how to stop dying to stun ganks)

Annie’s strongest lane pattern is: **hold stun → walk up → stun-Q → jungler arrives → you die.**

### Your anti-gank rules
- If Annie stun is up and you don’t see the jungler:  
  **you play like you are weak side.**
- Ward timings:
  - **Early (around first/second wave crash attempt):** pixel brush
  - **If you get a crash:** deeper ward at raptors / river entrance
- When you ward, choose a side to play toward and **hug that side**.

### How you punish Annie if she roams
Annie’s roams are dangerous if she arrives with stun + R. If she leaves lane:
- Either **match immediately** (only if you will arrive in time), or
- **Hard shove and take plates**, then reset and move with tempo.

---

## Mid game plan (where you outscale her impact)

Annie becomes a teamfight threat because of **Flash-Tibbers** picks.

Your plan:
- Push a wave → **disappear into fog**.
- Threaten picks on rotations (support/adc moving to ward).
- Play early around objectives and punish face-checks.

### Teamfight rule vs Annie
**You are not allowed to be the first person Annie can Flash-stun.**  
If Annie is off the map, assume she’s looking for that angle.

**Good fight:** Annie uses stun/Tibbers on someone else → you enter and clean up.  
**Bad fight:** you R in → get stunned → explode → your team loses.

## Common mistakes vs Annie (and the fix)

- **Mistake:** “I R’d in because I saw a health bar.”  
  **Fix:** R only when stun is down or you can guarantee dodge/exit.
- **Mistake:** “I used W for movespeed and got stunned.”  
  **Fix:** In this matchup, W is your **anti-stun** button first.
- **Mistake:** “I stayed in lane at 40% HP.”  
  **Fix:** Reset. Annie’s entire kit punishes low HP.
- **Mistake:** “I matched Annie’s roam late.”  
  **Fix:** Match instantly or don’t match — late matches lose lane and lose river.

---

## Quick in-game checklist (use before every commit)

Before you R / dive / fight:
1. **Is Annie stun up?** (4 stacks = NO GO)
2. **Is Tibbers up?**
3. **Is Flash up?**
4. **Do I have W ready to dodge the stopping spell?**
5. **Do I know where the jungler is?**
6. **If the kill doesn’t happen in 2 seconds, how do I leave?** (E path / teammate / second R)
